When you just simply have a deep identity 
level change as far as socializing or  
generating attraction, you don't really have 
to do that much because you've had that deep  
identity level change. Okay? So, there's this 
kind of sub layer of communication. We call  
that subcommunication. It's just the communication 
beneath the surface. And you can in effect choose  
to manipulate your subcommunication to an extent. 
But then from there ideally you're not burning all  
this energy manipulating it and being a chameleon. 
Rather you have a deep identity level change and  
then what happens is simply the communication 
changes on its own based on what's going on in  
between your ears. Now in saying that it sounds 
ideal right we say to ourselves that sounds very  
ideal like you know if you just took on the right 
beliefs like if you just believe in yourself and  
you just love yourself then you could just be 
yourself and everyone love you and so on and so  
forth right but the problem is is that if you tell 
that to somebody who is not that experienced it  
doesn't really do anything okay like um how much 
experience do you have in my content? Yeah, I've  
seen you before, right? Uh, probably been I've 
seen almost all your YouTube videos. Okay. Uh,  
okay. So, like, let let me show you an So, here, 
come out to the front for a second. Okay. Let me  
let me just show you something. Okay. Awesome. So, 
right. So, let's say, you know, say that I just  
kind of like I'll kind of squeeze you over the mic 
here. Um, just kind of roll with me. This is not  
like the best setup, but we'll just go like this. 
Okay. So, say that you hold this right here. Okay.  
So, put the mic about here. Okay. So, say that 
I say to you like like uh what's your name? My  
name is Casey. Okay, cool. Okay, so Casey, uh, 
where do you live? I live in, uh, Reton. Just  
moved there. You live in Reton. Okay. Uh, and 
are you, uh, do you have a lot of hobbies? Um,  
kind of. I watch some watch some sports. I work 
a lot for my family. Okay, got it. Now, okay,  
so say that I say that to Casey, right? So, 
um, now let's say that I say to Casey, Casey,  
you know, the way that you're going to change is 
you've got to learn to believe in yourself. Okay?  
You've got to learn. You got to learn to 
love yourself. Do you believe in yourself,  
Casey? I do. Yeah. Do you love yourself? I do. 
Cool. Now, uh so tell them maybe what some of  
your favorite music is. My favorite music um 
you know, I actually don't listen to music too  
often cuz I feel like the emotions in the music 
kind of impacts my personality too much. So,  
I don't listen to music too often. Okay. So, 
what we saw there was a marginal improvement  
in his communication. You guys see that by 
saying believe in yourself. But ultimately,  
if I send him out to a bar or a club and then I 
just keep saying, "Believe in yourself and so on  
and so forth," it's not likely to be a dramatic 
difference. So self-belief is one component of  
personal transformation. Okay? But the way that 
I would think about it is that we want to be we  
want to hit it from every single angle. So we want 
to look at at behavior modification to an extent  
where he would mechanically work on his voice, 
mechanically work on his body language. you know,  
your friend back there telling you to pull your 
your shoulders back, you know, things like that,  
right? But look, the truth is and and that's great 
advice, but at the same time, like even if I do  
this, I'm still basically the same guy. Okay? 
Even if I'm like this and and like I look like  
I'm scared, like I'm scared, I still am basically 
the same guy. Like, is this really that different?  
If I if I do this, is it that different? It's not 
dramatically different than if I do if I do this,  
is it that different? Right? There's not a 
dramatic difference. It's kind of just screaming  
out of you. So, we initially shift physiology and 
we initially shift voice. And then the thing is is  
that what'll happen is that if we if we tell him, 
"Believe in yourself." It's Casey, right? Casey,  
believe in yourself. Love yourself, Casey. Okay. 
So, if we do that, that will maybe shift him five  
or 10%, maybe 20%, cuz we're speaking positive 
things into him, you know, right? Like, you're  
a good guy, man. I love you, bro. You're a good 
freaking guy, Casey. Thank you. You're welcome.  
Okay. Right. So, you know, you're speak it's like 
uh you ever see um the messages in the water where  
they talk about that, you know, the water you you 
say I love you to the water and it gets a little  
snowflakes in it and if you say mean things to it, 
it gets like all these weird things. Is that even  
real? Someone's got I I have a hard time believing 
that's real. But a lot of people say it's real.  
But I will say this, it whether it's real or not, 
when people speak nice things into you, it really  
makes you blossom. And you know, when people are 
being nice to you, it makes you feel good, right?  
So whether it's true in the water or not, I don't 
know. The whole idea though, the messages in the  
water, you can look this up. It's like a famous 
in like new age woo woo circles like be positive.  
And I think the message whether true or not, it 
has a point which is to be freaking positive,  
right? So if we can get you speaking positively 
to yourself, get you believe in yourself, that's  
going to be part of a shift. But then from there, 
I think what we also have to do is some degree  
of behavior modification. And then what you do is 
as he improves his voice, as he improves his body  
language, as we can improve his verbal so that 
he can talk and talk, shifts in cadence and tone,  
being dominant, uh looking like he's higher in 
the hierarchy, then what happens is that as he  
starts to take on that those characteristics, 
it'll help him. But what's the problem? If we  
just do behavior modification, what happens? He 
doesn't believe. He may not believe it. So what'll  
happen with the behavior modification? It'll come 
across in many cases in. So, we're going to be  
shooting into a video today on the topic of how 
to make cash, how to get spiritually tapped in,  
and how to use your social skills in order to 
get there. And as we go in the video, you might  
notice that I'm in Chicago right now. You got the 
Trump Tower over there. We're sitting here on one  
of the many, many, many beautiful bridges right 
out here in Chicago. And why I'm here is actually  
do a completely free event this weekend. So, if 
you're somebody who wants to attend a completely  
free event, and this is the kind of event that 
would normally be about five grand to attend. It's  
going to go way deep and help you to build a huge 
network. We're going to go out tonight. It's going  
to be awesome. Make sure that you click the link 
below, and I'll see you out here in Chicago. Okay?  
I urge you to fly in for it. It is unbelievable 
being at a free event. In the meantime, though,  
enjoy this video. It's going to go very, very, 
very deep, and I'm excited to see you soon. Let's  
do it. So we might say use eye contact and then 
he's like okay I'm using my eye contact and he's  
got kind of like bug eye right like he's forcing 
it. You see that right? So it's like we've got to  
work on the beliefs and then we've got to work 
on the behavior. And so what happens is that  
initially what we have is we train the beliefs 
the correct beliefs right? Then what we do is  
we train where he's focusing. Okay. What is he 
focusing on? Then what we do is we train um okay  
so it's like beliefs then we change his focus 
okay where his brain's focusing then we change  
his physiology okay then what'll happen is if we 
shift that what'll happen is he'll start to get  
better reference experiences and then from those 
better reference experiences he will begin to  
believe the kind of false beliefs that we put in 
the mostly being you're the man, you're awesome,  
you're you're super cool, right? Which he may not 
feel right away, but he'll begin to get evidence  
of that. That evidence will therefore make it 
easier for him to focus on the positive. It  
will make it easier for him to be congruent when 
he's, you know, better body language, eye contact,  
uh, vocal use, so on and so forth. You know, 
humor, frame control, and so on and so forth.  
That makes it easier. And then what'll happen is 
it will continually be what's called a flywheel.  
Okay? I'll bring you up later and when we'll 
show some improvement. Okay? Okay. Have a seat.  
Give me a hand, guys. So, so in in effect now 
we can see with Casey also. Casey, you're I like  
you a lot. You are a little bit on the introverted 
side. Would that be fair to say? Yeah, I've gotten  
better over the years. Okay. Well, it's good. It's 
Yeah. So, you've come from a from a lower place,  
but you have a degree of introversion, right? 
So, what I'm doing is I'm kind of fighting this  
uphill battle where I'm trying to get you to a 
different place. I'm trying to get you to a space  
of transformation. So now I harp on this all the 
time and it and it just is something that I just  
I talk about this a lot because I feel like I'm 
the only person talking about this and a big part  
of me wants to just lay off this whole freaking 
thing that I keep arguing about. But I talk about  
this because it drives me crazy and I don't think 
other people are talking about it. You've got to  
believe that your looks and money are not holding 
you back. You've got to believe that. That doesn't  
mean that you can't go out and make more money. 
That doesn't mean that you can't go hit the gym.  
do those things, but do them for you. But the the 
thing is is that if you were to go right now and  
gain 30 pounds of raw muscle and then you doubled 
your income and you come up here, in most cases,  
your voice is still the same. You're still a 
little bit introverted. You still probably don't  
know how to free associate and talk and talk. You 
probably don't know how to how to be within your  
own frame. You probably don't know how to actively 
control frames. You probably don't have humor  
right off the tip of the tongue. you probably 
haven't taken the time to look at your funnel  
as to where you're meeting people and how you're 
kind of moving and leading it forward and so on  
and so forth. Maybe you've done some of those 
things in your study and you've come a long way,  
but you see, but like to me, bro, like even though 
I know you've come a long way, how many times have  
we met in person? This is the second time. Second 
time. Was it previously at another free event? Oh,  
yeah. Okay. So, the thing is that you've 
been to free events, but if you're at one  
of my proper tradings where we go out, like 
this is the kind of thing that we fix fast,  
okay? Like we don't because you got to understand 
if people take a proper training with me and they  
come out of it not dramatically transformed. 
They become my version of advertisement. They're  
my word of mouth. So if I allow you to leave 
that training without a radical transformation,  
you may be running around and then you'll tell 
people like oh I trained with Owen. We went out  
and then they'll say oh like you know what are 
your results like now? You're like I don't know.  
And so so what happens is I have pressure on me 
in the time that we have to create a very very  
radical transformation. Now, funny enough, if you 
want to know a a that's my legacy and humanitarian  
component, but I think it's also important to have 
a selfish component. My selfish component is if I  
can show you how to have a radical transformation 
and execute on it, and then you wind up making  
a lot more money. You will train with me for the 
rest of your life, not waiting for it to start to  
work, but because it did work and because you're 
making more money. And so, you wind up training  
with me because you're making more cash. So that's 
my I'm not saying that that is going to happen  
with 100% of people. But what I'm saying is that 
is how I have maintained a business over the years  
is a huge amount of my clients just get rich and 
then what happens is they come back and they take  
more training and eventually they wind up taking 
one-on-one trainings or they wind up booking me  
for a one-on-one for a month and you can imagine 
what we charge for that. So it's one of those  
things where um it's in my selfish interest to 
teach you this stuff because you wind up working  
me uh working with me for the rest of your life 
not out of deficit but out of thriving. Okay, my  
ideal when I have clients, I want to get it where 
they're [ __ ] scared that I'm going to fire them.  
You guys see that? I want a room full of clients 
that are scared that I'm going to fire them. So,  
when I'm at one of my proper trainings, I don't 
have to upsell anybody. Literally, they're scared  
that I won't keep teaching it. They're coming 
to me going, "How do we keep you doing this,  
man? We all love this. Like, we all want to come 
to the next one. How do we keep you doing this?  
This is awesome." That's the kind of teacher that 
I want to be. I want I want to be getting someone  
so much results that they keep coming back to 
me. And that's how that's why I don't even need  
to have a huge audience. I don't need to have a 
huge social media. And I mean, if you guys know,  
you could probably guess how much money 
I make a year. Can anybody guess? I mean,  
how is it possible? You guys see the lifestyle 
that I live, right? And I live in LA and there's  
people with like 20 million followers that come 
over to my house and they're and they'll literally  
look around. They'll be like, "But but but you 
your last video only had 50k views. Do do you  
have like a different Google YouTube partnership 
program or something? Like what kind of Google ads  
are you running? You know, I'm like I don't even 
have ads on my channel. They just put it there.  
They put it there now without your permission, by 
the way. Or sometimes for the music that I put on,  
but I I've never even been monetized on YouTube or 
social media. I have no monetization whatsoever.  
So why is it that I have a 8 figureure business 
um with a small audience? What am I doing? High  
value. You've got it. What am I, guys? Think about 
this. Why do I have an 8 figureure business with  
such a small audience? Master communicator. Master 
communicator. What else? Niche. Niche. What else?  
Because you don't see a lot of eight figureure 
coaches. That's rare. I'm a nine figure coach  
lifetime. You don't see a lot of eight figureure 
coaches. It's rare. You don't see a lot of eight  
figure YouTubers. It's very rare. So, what is it 
about me that allows me to do this? I want you I  
want you guys to really think about this. Okay? 
I want you guys to think about this. Results and  
you change lives. I deliver results. I changed 
lives. Amazing. What else? You genuinely help  
people improve and then they have goodwill towards 
you and they want to reinvest and they want to  
support what you're doing. Yeah. And and they do 
it because they love me, but also cuz they make  
cash. So, you know, if you guys are working with 
me and then suddenly you start making more cash,  
do you want to come back and keep working me and 
you have more cash? Keep working me. So, look, I'm  
not guaranteeing that, okay? I'm not that's called 
a pyramid scheme. I'm not guaranteeing that, okay?  
So, don't take me that way. But that's what I'm 
trying to do. And in many cases, I'm successful.  
Okay? And in some cases, I've been able to coach 
people that became so rich that they're world  
famous. And and many of the biggest YouTubers and 
people that you see came through my trainings.  
Many of the top entrepreneurs have come through 
my trainings, like biggest in the world. It's  
really crazy. Politicians, all sorts of stuff. So, 
I don't need to compete on view counts on YouTube  
or anything like that. I can just keep enjoying 
my life. And I can even run free events whenever  
I want and just travel around and travel with 
my kids and live my best life. And I can do that  
because I deliver results. Now, I'm saying this 
because and because I don't normally say this in  
my videos specifically. I don't normally drag this 
on, but I wanted to mention this because I want to  
get you thinking the fact that I'm taking someone 
like you and I'm completely transforming you. That  
doesn't happen. That's not like a thing. Do you 
understand? That's not a thing. Other than this  
environment, it's very rare that somebody actually 
has a transformation like that. more. What you'll  
see is internet marketers that make like an ebook 
or some audio thing and then they put 99% of their  
time into what's called a VSSL, a video sales 
letter. They make a bunch of sales off it. The  
guy watches like the first 10 or 20% of it before 
he gives up on it. They make a bunch of cash off  
cold traffic or whatever and the guy moves on with 
his life. How many teachers have the [ __ ] balls  
to say, "I'm going to take you out. I'm going to 
go do it." Okay, me. I'm going to go show it. I'm  
going to go show everything I'm saying. live. Do 
you understand how consistent I have to be? What  
consistent level results that I have to be able to 
produce to be able to say I'm going to go do this  
live and then I've got to get cuz it's not just 
me. It's not just Well, I watched him do it and he  
did it. I've got to get you doing it. Okay? I've 
got to get you doing it, too. So, can you imagine  
the degree of surgery, mental surgery that I have 
to do in order to create a transformation like  
that? Like, I'm taking some random guy. Remind me, 
was it Kyle? He said Casey, I'm horrible. I'm I'm  
a bad man. Okay. So So Casey I've got Casey here. 
Casey comes to me, you know, tossing me a little  
cash. You know, he probably saved up for it and 
he's like, "I saved up for this [ __ ] Fix me, oh  
guru." And I'm like, "Oh, [ __ ] What have I got 
myself into?" Right? And I live this high stress,  
high cortisol lifestyle for two decades. Okay? 
Can you imagine the stress of somebody flying in  
from like South Africa or Europe, where the [ __ ] 
they [ __ ] fle Asia, where the [ __ ] they flew  
in from. Look, even if they're from LA and we're 
doing it in LA, they still put a lot into it,  
right? And they're like, "Owen, I'm just trusting 
you to do this for me. Transform me, Owen,  
take me. Take my 30 years of [ __ ] habits, my 30 
years of being an introvert, my 30 years of my dry  
penis, my 30 years of my sad life, my low income, 
my betess, and fix it. Turn me into a raging stud.  
Do it. You've got 4 days. Go. Right? Can you imag 
Why do you guys think I look pissed off and angry  
and stressed all the time? Like, and and I do 
this every freaking weekend, right? you know,  
on the train guys like, "Okay, man. Like, I got to 
see you do it." Like, "Oh, here you go. Come on,  
man. Show me the goods." Right? And I got to be 
able to do it on command. But then it's like,  
"Hey, well, now I saw you do it. Can I do it?" 
Then I got to do it on command and get you doing  
it. Okay? So, again, I'm saying that I'm going 
to post this. Okay? I don't normally post if I  
go to rant like this. I don't even norally talk 
about this at events, but I'm talking about it  
because as we go into the work that I'm showing 
you, I want to put in context that I've had to  
dig deep in order to create this content. I've 
had to dig deep. Okay? I've had to dig very,  
very, very deep. Man, I also want to be clear. 
I got a lot of big I got a big ass ego. Okay,  
don't buy into my [ __ ] of Echartole. Like, lose 
your ego. I've got the biggest ego you've ever  
[ __ ] seen. I've got a massive out of control 
narcissistic raging demon ego that just runs me.  
Okay. And so I'm so that's why I had to read so 
much echartole. Okay. Like I'm not like I'm not  
like some chill dude who like read echartole 
because it naturally resonates. Basically,  
I was so out I was like this raging Napoleonic 
maniac for like years and years and then I  
finally read a cart tool and that just allowed 
me not to have a heart attack before 50. Okay,  
I'll still probably have a heart attack at 50, but 
it allowed me not to have a heart attack. I might  
make it till 50. Let's be honest, like if we had 
to pick one person in this room right now out of  
all of us in this room to just flat die of a heart 
attack in the next 30 seconds, who would it be?  
Yeah, it'd be you. Me, right? So, because yeah, I 
have I have an ego about it. And let me tell you  
a bit of where that ego comes from. Back in the 
day in the community, we were competitive. Like,  
it was very very very competitive. You know, you 
were out in Vegas and you were out to see who had  
the best skills. You want to see who had the best 
skills and you're with your boys and you and now  
you didn't compete on the internet. Like, who can 
trash each other the most from over the internet  
and like talk [ __ ] and never have to prove it? 
We'll just say stuff. Oh, on the internet. No,  
we met up in real life and we could we would 
compete and we would compete with everything from  
uh you know, see who got, you know, week in 
Vegas, let the best man win or in many cases,  
and we did this consensually. So, don't be don't 
be coming up on me doing this, you going to piss  
me off, but consensually, you know, we would 
kind of see each other in social interactions  
and maybe just kind of an understanding that we 
both had just to have a little fun. You know,  
maybe you're chatting with somebody and I just 
kind of again, we've pre-agreed on this. We're  
not doing this out of nowhere. That's that's 
going to get you in a fight with random people,  
by the way. But we knew we're doing it, right? 
You'd be chatting and maybe I'd come in and hey,  
what's up? Right. And I could kind of see 
if I could kind of dummy you a little bit,  
kind of sun you a little bit, you know, kind of 
take what you got going on and walk off with it,  
right? And we did a lot of that. I mean, this 
just went on and on and on for decades. Okay. So,  
there was a there was a lot of competition. But 
the other competition, this is a huge competition,  
was results for our clients. Could we get results 
for clients? like what did your clients results  
look like? We also had competition based on public 
speaking. So you'd see different instructors over  
the years and you know we'd all do a summit. 
We'd all meet up together and everybody would  
go on stage and we'd actually compete and see 
who did the best. But notice that like if like  
me and all my crew we would all kind of be like 
it was always the guy that was trying the hardest  
that would get a little bit better. Like maybe 
somebody got lazy for a month and then the other  
guys would would surpass him. Or maybe a guy ran 
less seminars for a month and then the other guys  
would surpass him. So, have you guys ever sense 
that kind of competitiveness that you'll see in  
my videos? Like, I'm trying to make the best video 
I physically can. I'm trying to do the best speech  
I physically can. I do the best tradings I 
physically can. That is the culture that I  
came up in. It was just competitive. But it wasn't 
competitive like kick somebody else down and then  
lie to yourself and say that you're better because 
you can talk [ __ ] to someone that you're not in  
their physical presence. Instead, it was more 
about a friendly competition and learning from  
each other and competition that was actually built 
so that um you would you would level each other  
up. It was all it was all about leveling up. It 
was not about kicking somebody else down. And as  
other guys got better, you'd learn off of them and 
they would learn off of you. And then you'd all  
go grab a steak dinner and you'd all be laughing 
about it and joking around. It was all meant to be  
fun. It wasn't bitter and so on and so forth. 
Um you know, I'm from Canada. Like in Canada,  
if you've got a problem with somebody, you go 
tell them in person. You don't talk about on  
the internet. You just go talk in person about 
what your issue is, you don't try to like take  
your little tribe and recruit them against the 
other person and make up a bunch of [ __ ] You  
just go talk to them in person. How [ __ ] up 
is that that people on the internet these days,  
I'm saying this at 45 years old, they'll try to 
recruit, like say that you get like a bunch of  
views. Why would you try to recruit a small little 
army against somebody else? What would happen if  
somebody in that little brainwash army would 
go and assault that other person without you  
knowing it and then you cause that because you 
don't know a crazy person said that. So that's  
why you'll never see me trashing somebody else 
on the internet because I don't want to cause  
harm to them. That's that's super [ __ ] up that 
people do that. So I'm competitive, but I'm not  
competitive on the internet. I'm competitive in 
real life and I'm competitive in a way where I  
know that I'm going to lose sometimes because 
I've gotten around better people than me. And  
then what I look to do is I look to surpass them 
not by kicking them down, but by learning from  
them and adopting their behaviors, adopting their 
changes, adopting a little bit of their kung fu,  
and then I'll surpass them, and then they'll see 
what I'm doing, and then they'll adopt a little  
bit of mine. That's the way that we ran this 
over the years. Okay? And we created a culture  
of ongoing friendly competition and real life 
competition and pressure amongst each other again  
in our own skill set but also in transforming 
our clients and getting them results as well.  
Then doing great videos uh you know doing awesome 
videos, doing awesome speeches, awesome seminars  
and I don't know that's kind of how I just live my 
entire adult life. That was how I did it. Um and  
that's what I love to do right. not ever looking 
to kick somebody else down, but I like to I but I  
look at what else is out there and I drive myself 
from there. You also have your legacy motivations,  
right? Like so much of what you do is built on 
the legacy that you want to create for your life.  
So I have a I I have a feeling of competition. 
Again, not to try to kick somebody else down,  
but in a healthy way. If I see some other man or 
woman building a great legacy, it's not that I  
want to kick down their legacy, but I say, "Well, 
look at what they're doing. That's awesome. Like,  
I want to build a legacy like that. I want to 
do that and then I try to learn from them and I  
try to get around them. Okay. I make I've made an 
active effort to try to get around the people who  
I admire uh and the people who I look up to. There 
was an old u old video game called Street Fighter.  
Any you guys see play the game Street Fighter 2 
back in the day? You guys remember Ken and Rayu?  
Right. So Ken and Rayu in the anime of Street 
Fighter. They would go around the world looking  
for other fighters to test their skills. That's 
how they would do it. So for me, whenever there's  
somebody who I think is is impressive, I try to go 
meet up with them in person and I'll just back up  
the brain truck and pay them whatever they want 
in order to learn from them. That's what I want  
to do. So look, I've had it to where I' I've been 
the one coaching a guy who makes a couple hundred  
million bucks or even guys that are billionaires 
and I'm coaching them and I'm sitting there at  
dinner and I'm like, "Man, this is cool that I 
can be at dinner with this guy. This is great,  
but I wish that this guy had a [ __ ] course that 
I could pay for because I've got to be polite  
at dinner and be civil and not start drilling 
him with questions, but I'm getting, you know,  
maybe one nugget every 20 minutes. I wish I could 
just pay him and then I could get a nugget every  
one minute and so on and so forth. So, what 
I did was I took trainings with everybody,  
okay? I took every workshop that I could. I went 
to every uh seminar that I could. I've learned  
one-on-one from people. I'll find people and just 
say, "Can I pay you? What do you want me to pay  
you?" I will pay you. Just come live at my house 
for a month and just teach me what you know. I'll  
pay you whatever you want. I know that that's 
probably out of reach for a lot of you guys,  
but I'd encourage you to make more money and to 
adopt that. You know who I who I saw doing a lot  
of that I amped up? My friend Tai Lopez. You ever 
seen Tai? Ty will just go find uh you know like  
like the Gracie brothers or whatever from MMA. Is 
it the Gracies? Hoist Gracie and these guys. Or  
it's u those guys from Brazil, whoever that was. 
or he'll go just recruit David Bus. Anybody who's  
really good, he just hires them and he just brings 
them over as traders. Now, notice that what he's  
not doing is looking at [ __ ] Tik Tok reels. He's 
not just allowing anyone into his mind. Okay? Not  
everybody gets access into his mind, right? He's 
not looking at random TV shows, random movies,  
random gurus, random people talking. Not everybody 
gets access. Ty talks about this all the time. Not  
everybody gets access to your brain. You've got 
to have the iron gate. All the [ __ ] idiots,  
which is like 99.9% of people that are not putting 
in the time like this, are blocked out. And then  
what you do is you get around the right people 
and then you take on information from them.  
And what you'll find is you not only take on the 
data that they're giving you, especially if it's  
the right training, but what you're also taking on 
is is fundamentally you're taking on it's almost  
like their spiritual vibration. You're taking 
on a little bit of their energy that, you know,  
their their kind of way that they have manifested 
their energy. You're also sinking to their thought  
patterns. You're and you're also syncing up to 
their standards and how they see the world. And  
you're syncing up to what it is that they focus 
on. Okay? And a lot of this is just learning how  
to be a consmate winner. And I really believe 
this particularly for men because as a woman,  
if you start to lose, what happens if you start 
like like for we've got a couple women in here,  
you know, what would happen to you? Like 
let's say that you were to fall on hard  
times. Say say you were single, you fell 
on hard times financially and you know like  
life was just getting a little tough and you 
felt a little vulnerable. What would happen?
A he goes he go he goes. Okay. So I'm just 
kidding. That's that's her significant other.  
Okay. So yeah, what's that? Casey or I find you 
on the dating app and we come white night. Yeah.  
Yeah. You you just can like look there's even 
girls that I'm dating back in LA and I'm gone  
for the month on a road trip and they're all, you 
know, pissy because I'm gone. And you'll see them  
say like, "Can anyone help me with this?" like 
right in their little status upgrade and things  
like that. It's not girls I'm exclusive with, but 
you know, it's like I'm not entertaining them. So,  
what's going to happen and they do that to piss 
me off too, but it's like they'll do that because  
other guys will come help them. Right? As soon 
as a girl's in a bit of a vulnerable place,  
a billion dudes come and help them. But if you're 
a man and you're in a little bit of a vulnerable  
headsp space, uh, are there women swarming you for 
sex? Do you get sworn for sex? You get swarm for  
lots of sex when you're vulnerable and things are 
when you're losing like I'm a little sad today.  
Can anyone come make me feel better? Can anyone 
give me a massage? Can it not that I smoke weed,  
but can anyone bring me over some weed? You 
know, you'll see that on Instagram. Can anyone  
bring over some drinks? Can anyone take me for 
a hike? Things like that, right? You'll see that  
on Instagram. And they do it cuz it works. They 
absolutely do it cuz it works. I mean, let's be  
honest, like half the time that that happens, if 
if you if you met that girl out and and she posts  
something like that, if you don't like rapidly 
respond, like that means there's an opening,  
right? If you don't rapidly respond to go meet 
up with her, like she'll probably become someone  
else's girlfriend. So, you you better respond 
quick. Like most women that I've dated over  
the course of my life that probably the window 
popped for about seven minutes, I spotted I went  
shot through the window uh metaphorically and 
literally. And as a result of that, you know,  
we wound up dating. So that's what it's like to 
be a woman. As a man, look, I'm sorry to say,  
as a man, you just got to keep winning. As a 
man, it's got to be like a nonstop streak of just  
winning. Okay? It's got to be this uninterrupted 
boulevard of green lights. Repeat that after me.  
Uninterrupted Boulevard of green lights. And you 
and you and and when it's not, lie, [ __ ] lie.  
Okay. In other words, you know, if you're on if 
you're on a date with somebody and they're like,  
"Tell me about your hardest thing." Don't 
be, "Well, you know, it's been hard. Like,  
I'm kind of broke right now." And, you know, 
my girl dumped me cuz I was kind of a chump.  
And like all said, "No, no, no, no, no, no." 
Okay. Just joke around, ignore the question,  
and if any logical information does come out, 
it's just winning and winning and winning and  
winning. That's how it's got to be. And so, as 
a guy, you've got to be trading off the masters  
all the time. And by the way, the reason why you 
train off the masters is this. You do it because  
you value your time. You do not want to waste your 
time. Okay? You're not sitting there wasting your  
freaking time. Um, I have personally learned from 
so many people and I regret that I didn't learn  
from more. I regret every stupid ass thing that I 
looked at that wasted my time, that raped my brain  
by me allowing it in for some stupid ass [ __ ] 
reason. Okay? Because you've got to know what  
it is that you want out of life. And if that data 
or information is not helping you to get what you  
want out of life, it's just [ __ ] garbage. Okay? 
It's your enemy. It is your enemy. It is evil.  
[ __ ] that information. [ __ ] the people that 
said it. [ __ ] the device that got it to you.  
[ __ ] all of it. Just get the right stuff in 
between your ears. Straight up. Go out, train,  
learn from the best, go to the top. Straight up. 
And most people won't do that. By the way, look,  
even if you look, for example, at more socialist 
political parties, they're always saying like,  
"Oh, these people have it hard." Let's go look at 
their search history on their phone, okay? Like,  
oh yeah, it's so hard. It's so hard. I live in 
the richest country in the world and I can't make  
money. Oh, my life is so tough. And it's so hard 
to be me. Oh my god. Okay, let me see your search  
history. Get out your phone. What are you looking 
at? What are you putting in your brain? Look,  
I remember this this one girl I was on a on a 
date with. She started telling me how hard her  
life was. Later, I found out that she has a coke 
habit. Okay? Like, you're frying your own brain,  
but yet you think that your life, you think 
you're a victim. You think your life is hard,  
but you're actively frying your own brain. What 
is worse than literally just snorting drugs,  
frying your own [ __ ] brain. If you fry your 
own, if you take drugs, if you ever take drugs,  
you can never be mad at anybody. You could, your 
only enemy is yourself. No enemy came in and made  
you take drugs. You took the drugs. So, never look 
at other people as your enemy. Look at yourself as  
your enemy. Okay? So, in other words, eliminate 
the bad [ __ ] Get around great mentors. Pick  
which habits are going to get you to where it is 
that you want to go. Install the mentalities in,  
okay? Install the psychology and the mentalities. 
Install the behaviors. Install the paradigms.  
Install the the path to mastery that it is that 
you're going to have to take. Install all of those  
things. And then what you've got to do after 
you've done all that is you've got to go get  
around other people that are hyper motivated and 
have a little bit of friendly competition with  
them. Learn from each other, learn from mentors, 
and take action. Now, this is how, let me be very,  
very clear. Nobody is making you do any of this. 
Okay? Can I be clear about that? Nobody is making  
you do any of this. You don't have to do this. You 
can do whatever you want. You can sit there. You  
can smoke weed. You can think that you're getting 
enlightenment from psychedelics while your brain  
fries. You can do uh, you know, television, Tik 
Tok, eat a bunch of crap. You can do whatever you  
want. If you are genuinely happy with where your 
life is right now, you can literally do whatever  
you want. You don't have to do anything if you 
understand what I'm telling you. Okay? This is  
only if you want change. That's it. It's only if 
you want change. So, why do you guys think that I  
decided to undertake this kind of lifestyle? Like 
it's not it's not like uh I had to do it. Nobody  
made me do any of this stuff. Nobody made me. So 
why why did I do this? You want it? I want it.  
Why do I want it? Pain. Pain. Mhm. Growth. Pain. 
Yes. Growth. Yeah. Can I give you guys another  
reason? Sure. I just think regular lifestyle 
is boring. Yeah. I find it to be actively under  
stimulating. It's under stimulating for me. So 
I don't really like when I looked at my life  
um like I had a uh uh an internship in high school 
at Nortell and I saw what it looked like to have  
a 9 toive job and I saw what it was like to be 
judged by a boss who maybe didn't see how hard  
you're working and how much it sucked. I saw the 
quality of the people that I could date without  
actively learning social skills. I saw the way 
that I was disrespected. I saw the way that I  
would walk into a room and not garner respect. 
I saw how limited my life was. I saw that and I  
and and then I saw the quality of the television 
and movies and then I tried drinking beer in high  
school with my dad and watching telev and watching 
hockey and I would literally sit there trying to  
drink beer and trying to watch hockey and which is 
kind of the thing to do in Canada and I couldn't  
figure out why people found it fun. I couldn't 
figure it out. I just found it boring. So then I  
said to myself,"Well, what are the things that I 
would want to do?" And what I realized is I want  
to have a way better dating life. I just want to 
have a way better dating life. And by the way,  
guys are always saying things like, "I don't care 
about that. Like modern women are [ __ ] and I  
don't care." And I'm like, "Yeah, right, 
bro." Like shut the [ __ ] up. Right now,  
that same girl that you're calling a [ __ ] 
if she was naked on your bed and was asking  
you to c to come over and cuddle up with her, you 
wouldn't be like modern women. Okay? You wouldn't  
be saying that. you would shut the [ __ ] up. 
So, okay. So, it's your problem. If you're not  
able to to create a situation where whether a 
classical woman or modern woman or whatever,  
wants to actually be nice to you or be receptive 
to you, then maybe you should actually figure out  
how to shift your behavior. Because to be honest, 
it's really not rocket science to study how to  
generate organic proper attraction without the 
girls being social pressure that they have to like  
a beta male. It's not that hard to actually learn. 
Likewise, it's not that hard to make money in the  
richest country in the world. If you're looking at 
this from the States, the richest major country,  
or in modern society, when things like internet 
marketing exists, it's not that hard to make  
cash. And then from there, it's also not that hard 
to leave a legacy because you got to understand,  
people back in the day want to leave a legacy. 
It'd be some guy like Martin Luther King. He's  
got to go get shot or you've got to go into some 
kind of crazy war and get shot at. Or maybe you're  
maybe you're like living in the 1800s. You've got 
to go, you know, tame the Wild Wild West and and  
and have all this violence and chaos. This is 
not hard. Nothing about life today is hard. I  
see all these guys talking about like, I built my 
business. I've got to hustle. It's so hard. I'm  
like, what we do is not hard. Stop. Right? Like, 
it takes real dedication and challenge to build  
a business. What are you talking about? What are 
you even saying? What delusions have you have you  
fed yourself? This is a laundry machine of false 
feedback. You sound like a [ __ ] leftist. You  
know what I'm saying? like these entrepreneurs 
like like the leftist like I'm a victim and the  
system's against me. It's like the entrepreneur 
like I just work so hard so hard. Shut the [ __ ]  
up. This was not hard. You're not you're not like 
here I am on the railroad putting in the spikes.  
Okay. You're not like like deep in a [ __ ] coal 
mine with a canary dying and having to run up.  
You're not you're not sitting there like building 
dynamite and it blows up. You're not a janitor.  
You're some guy who built an online business. Shut 
the [ __ ] up. This wasn't hard. What I did wasn't  
hard. What a janitor does is hard. What a guy 
working 9 to5 does, which mind-numbing doesn't  
commit suicide is hard. That's [ __ ] hard. Not 
blowing your own brains out when you have a 9 to5.  
This [ __ ] isn't hard. Being rich isn't hard. 
What? Just like make some dumb online business  
and count the cash while you go on a vacation and 
get your dick sucked. You're calling that hard?  
Like you're running around in a in a Lambo 
in a [ __ ] $100,000 watch and you're like,  
"This is hard. It's hard to get my dick sucked and 
spend millions of dollars because I set up some  
dumb fuddle on the internet. Shut the [ __ ] 
up. Okay, it's not hard. Oh, it's hard these  
days to have a dating life because of like, you 
know, modern society ruined it. It's really that  
hard. You really You couldn't meet one, huh? You 
couldn't find one. You couldn't find one person to  
date. You couldn't find one person for significant 
other. Not even one. Because you are so unique.  
You are such a unique victim and the whole world 
is just against you. Yeah. In fourthwave feminism  
where women high-five each other when they get 
[ __ ] down, you couldn't get a date. Okay.  
Like back in the 50s, you had to show up with like 
some [ __ ] flowers or dad was about to shoot you,  
you know, right? Like like you had a date 
for like two [ __ ] years. You had to show  
intention. You had to you had to show you had 
to be a gentleman. You had to get the door. You  
had to get the chair. You had to bring you had to 
[ __ ] make a bring a [ __ ] picnic basket. Okay,  
now she's literally high-fiving her friends going, 
"Did you get dick? Did he come blast you? Okay,  
did he cream buy you? High five." And you couldn't 
figure out how to get a date. Okay? Like back in  
the day to build a business, you'd have to have 
a brickandmortar company. You'd have to have you  
you have to go to investors, get the investment 
money, build some kind of a physical product,  
put in something you could only sell in your local 
town. You know, you live in like Timbuktu, Kansas,  
and you're just praying that the 13 other people 
that live there will come by your [ __ ] widget  
that you had to borrow money to get. Now you have 
the internet with like an AI AI mark of the beast  
spy grid spying on everybody in order to find out 
who wants what, but you couldn't figure that out.  
You couldn't figure it out. I just couldn't. 
I just don't have the energy. I don't have the  
motivation to figure it out. I can't solve the 
problem. Let me tell you something. Motivation  
is not even a thing. Do you understand that? 
Motivation is not even a thing. There is no  
issue with motivation ever. Here's why. If you're 
saying that, if you think right now, you're like,  
"If I could just work on my motivation, let me 
explain this to you, okay? For every one dumb  
[ __ ] who says, "I don't have the motivation." Do 
you understand that there's some people out there  
who don't struggle with motivation that are going 
to eat your lunch? They are going to take what you  
have and they are going to eat your lunch. Okay? 
Because I do not struggle with motivation. So if  
if you struggle with motivation and I don't, I'm 
going to out compete you every single time. So you  
cannot have a lack of motivation. Motivation 
is entrylevel [ __ ] Okay. Um uh what's his  
name? the guy that did uh the the Jordan coach um 
the guy that coached Jordan, Evan Phil Jackson,  
Timothy S. Grover, right? He's like he's like uh 
he's like not everyone is a beast. Not everyone's  
going to they're going to go kill him next 
year. Okay, motivation is entrylevel. That  
is that's entrylevel. That's an entrylevel form 
of psychology. Like I'm working on my motivation.  
That means that you're literally sitting there 
on step zero. There's there's 20,000 steps and  
you're sitting there on on on you're sitting there 
on the home plate like just sitting there looking  
at the plate like maybe I'll get the motivation to 
like pick my bat up at some point. Oh, the bat's  
there. Uh oh no, I can't I can't do it. If I if 
I just picked that bat up, I'd be all set. No,  
you wouldn't. You still have to learn how to 
swing the bat. You still have to learn how to  
run around the bases. You still have to learn to 
catch a fly ball. Motivation. If you're struggling  
with motivation, you're not even at a point where 
you're even you're you're even starting. You're  
not even in the game at all. You're not allowed 
that's not a thing because you're not allowed  
to struggle with motivation. Does that make sense? 
Like like the the concept of of motivation implies  
that you think you have another option. It's like 
when guys will have a breakup and they'll say,  
"Should I try to get her back or work on myself?" 
Bro, she dumped you. She's not taking you back.  
The only answer that you have is to work 
on yourself. She's not taking you back,  
bro. If a girl dump you and you go back, she'll 
always view you as a [ __ ] So, she's not taking  
you back. In the same way, you don't actually have 
a choice between action and non-action. Because  
if you're in a state of non-action, right now, the 
social contract, the social contract used to be if  
you're a good little worker, you could have your 
factory job, you'd have a you'd have a wife, you'd  
have two kids, you'd have a retirement fund, you 
probably wouldn't get fired. the social contract  
was in place that you could probably work the same 
job most your life. If you were a six or a seven,  
you'd have a wife that's a six or a seven that 
would be relatively pleasant to you. You get  
some kids out of it and you could retire. That's 
how it used to be. Is that the is that the social  
contract anymore? What happens right now if you 
if you're not on top of your [ __ ] Do you get is  
that like that's what guys got when they weren't 
on top of their [ __ ] Because they collectively  
imposed those frames. But guys got lazy. They 
didn't maintain that. So now what happens to a  
mid-level guy? Does a mid-level guy um like 
everything just goes okay? So he maybe he's  
motivated, maybe he's not, maybe he doesn't feel 
like taking action. I don't know what happens to  
a mid-level guy. Annihilated. He's demolished. 
Yeah. I mean, it's crazy crazy bad. Okay. It's  
super bad. So motivation is not even a thing. 
like like the word motivation should be removed  
from your vocabulary because that means that 
that's even a choice like it's a choice for me  
to take action or not to take action. So then from 
there what you start to do is you start to say  
to yourself what is it that I want like what am I 
trying to build? What is it that I want? And then  
what you do is you create some kind of a game plan 
and then you start knocking down wins. And again,  
I think for guys particularly, you've got to just 
keep winning over and over and over. Here's why.  
What happens as a guy when you start taking 
else? Your brain chemistry and your hormones.  
It's horrible. Yeah. It's like it's like a living 
hell. Y Yeah. What happens? I mean, it's just it  
just [ __ ] sucks. It takes forever to recover 
because you just you lose mo momentum and then  
you start getting negative paradigms on yourself 
around who you are as a person and where your life  
trajectory is. And it it takes like an incredible 
amount of leverage to just get back to where you  
were before everything got [ __ ] up, you know. 
Well, you start thinking that stuff and then you  
start attracting it and like you know your vibes 
start that starts screaming out of you that you  
are in that space and um it starts showing up. 
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Start showing up. Anybody else  
want want to talk about it? What happens when 
you start taking Lis as a guy? I mean I mean  
first of all your girlfriend's going to just go 
jump on some other dude within a millisecond.  
like prepare to have a baby that doesn't look like 
you. But what else? How would you describe it? Uh  
even like people that were once like for you, 
I feel like people start turning on you or like  
want to keep you down. Oh, people massively start 
turning on you and start taking L's. 100%. What  
else? What was you start taking L's a guy? People 
stop caring about you. They don't care about your  
problems. They don't even care about you at all. 
100%. I agree that except you're tight as friends.  
That will really come true for you. But other 
than that, definitely test your friendships. What  
else happens if you're a guy you start taking L's? 
you just you stop getting opportunities like like  
because your your because your neurochemistry 
is [ __ ] up. Like people don't see you they  
don't see value in you and so they don't give you 
the same opportunities that you get when you're  
in momentum. 100%. How about as a how about your 
dating life? What happens if you go to a bar club  
when you're just racking up L's? You're racking 
up L's and you go to the bar. What happens? Yeah.  
I mean you go to a dark place. You go to a very 
very dark place. Yeah. You get a lot of positive  
attention when you're taking L's and you go out. 
No. How do you How do you guys describe it when  
you're taking L's? Losses. Taking losses. You're 
taking L's when you go out. How do you describe  
it? I start looping. Looping in the [ __ ] Yeah. 
Over and over. The disease. Yeah, that was that  
was a great one. Stay. Stand up. Stand up. Say 
to the crowd. It's like you're walking around  
with like a disease. Like everybody can just like 
feel the bad vibes and they just [ __ ] disperse.  
Like they're just like goodbye. Get the [ __ ] 
away from me. Yeah. Who here started taking L's  
and your girlfriend just spontaneously dumps 
you? Put your hand up if that's happen to you.  
Yeah. What was that like? You start taking L 
and your girlfriend just spontaneously dumps  
you. What's that like? Oh yeah, she is. Stand 
up. Stand up. Oh, it's like she looked at me  
like a different person. Like she was totally uh 
It wasn't like she was even angry at me. It was  
just that she just completely cut off cold. Yeah, 
you're dead. Basically, you died. Uh what else?  
Who here has ever had it where you you start 
taking L's, your girl just leaves? Put your  
hand up if that's happened to you. Put your hand 
way up if that's happened to you. Awesome. I want  
to hear some more stories. Okay, you started 
taking L's, she left. What happened? Stand up.
Um, yeah. I broke up with me then, uh, 
started getting my winner effect back on,  
back together. Yeah. Then uh started taking some 
L's, another letter, broke up with me again.  
Third time I was like, I gotta walk away, man. I 
I can't keep doing this dance. Was that a Canadian  
accent I heard? Oh, yeah. That's awesome, man. 
That's good [ __ ] Okay. Yeah. Yukon territory.  
Not No [ __ ] way. That's awesome. Okay. That's 
a real Canadian. Okay. I like that. Okay. Here.  
Share. Share some other ones. Okay. Uh took some 
L's, got dumb. Put your hand up if that's you.  
You had one, right? Yeah. Okay. You want to share? 
Yeah. It's just I would almost describe it as like  
apathy. like just doesn't she's not mad, she's not 
happy, she just doesn't give a [ __ ] Yeah. Didn't  
support you, huh? Okay. What? Okay. What else? Who 
else want to share one? Yep. Okay. I actually had  
a success story with it though. So, I remember 
the first with it's with it was with my wife too  
as well. I remember I took it was during COVID. We 
got evicted and we both got co and I was living in  
like a big villa in Bali and then lost literally 
everything. And my wife at the time had she had  
never seen me that low. And I remember I had to 
I literally went to a corn field to find God to  
get my frame back because I was like, "What the 
[ __ ] How are you treating me like this?" But I  
had to get my frame back from what I learned from 
you uh in Vegas and got that back and was able to  
maintain frame for the rest of our relationship. 
But I realized from that point forward,  
I can't show my wife that part of myself. Like, 
I got to get myself back. Yeah, that's awesome.  
And by the way, give my hand. That's awesome. 
And let me say something, too. I like there's  
always there's these all these like weird bloggers 
that are like, "Men need to learn to show more  
vulnerability." What they should be saying is 
guys should create groups with each other where  
they can show vulnerability. Okay? Like you don't 
start you don't start saying to a business owner,  
you know, go to your top clients and talk about 
how you're unraveling to your best clients,  
right? That is [ __ ] up to tell people that. 
But what you could say is that um you know,  
make a business networking group with other peers 
that are around the same level in business and  
share what's going on. Uh so it's really really 
bad advice. But do you guys see what I'm saying  
as far as like you're not allowed to start 
taking L's? Okay, you you've got to get that  
out of your head that you're allowed to take 
L's. That's not a thing. Do you understand?  
like motivation. Like you're not allowed to lack 
motivation. You're not allowed to start taking  
L's. You're not allowed to be a mid guy, like 
a middle class. Like you're not allowed. Now,  
when I say not allowed, is that like my little 
rule? I'm going to spank you. What am I referring  
to when I say it's not allowed? Like what am 
I saying? Like what am I even saying? You're  
going to take L's. It's going to happen. We're 
all human. This is a fallen world. But you need  
to maintain your frame. maintain pos some sense 
of positivity and connection too. I think that's  
a good point. But let me tell you another thing. 
How old are you? I'm 33. Okay. At a certain age,  
you got to just stop taking L's. Yeah. Do you 
see what I'm saying? So, you can take L's,  
but at at a certain point, man, you're too old for 
the L's. You know what I'm saying? You just got to  
stop. Okay. Look, in my case, I chose to teach 
very controversial material. So, massive massive  
L's come along with that territory. So, you know, 
the end of my story might be a pretty massive epic  
L. Okay, we already know that. But that was 
a choice that I made. It's like a sky diver,  
like like a base jumper that knows like, you 
know, there's like a 5-year trajectory. You know,  
stuff can happen. So, there's a certain choice 
that I made. But in general, for most of us,  
so I I've got a lot of L's that kind of that 
come from fallout that I've had from all the  
silly things that I've done. Okay. But what I'm 
getting at is that and it's like even things that  
you think weren't related to that are somehow tied 
to that that would never happen if it weren't for  
that. So, I will you know, the end of my story 
will probably be a pretty epically bad, but  
But the point that I'm get, okay, we already 
know that, but the point I mean maybe won't be,  
but we kind of know that, right? I mean, those 
are choices that I made. But what I'm trying to  
get at is, and don't feel bad for me in the same 
way, like, you know, like my buddy Sid does bass  
jumping, and he told me he's like, I just love 
bass jumping. Like, if you get the call one day  
that I'm dead, don't don't sit there like feel 
like you could cry or be upset or make a funeral,  
but like don't sit there feeling bad for me. I 
knew what I was getting into. So, we all make our  
choices, right? But in general, yes, you've got 
to reframe the L's and you got to keep your state  
good. We'll talk about that. But in addition, at 
a certain point, you just got to stop, bro. Like,  
why didn't you get the right mentor? Why didn't 
you install the right habits? Why didn't you sit  
down and build the right strategy? You've got to 
get you've got to get past like moral victories,  
like, well, it all happened for a reason. And 
you've got to just start winning at a certain  
point. Okay? So, and you've got and you've 
got to not get used to losing is a really  
big point. A lot of people are just so used to 
[ __ ] losing, they've lost track of even how  
to win. It's not even in their nervous system how 
to win anymore as opposed to anticipating the win  
and being a winner at your core. Okay? And I'll 
talk in more details, not just like, you know,  
vague tropes and whatnot. Okay? Um, so what I'm 
saying is if you what I'm getting at is this,  
okay? In our society right now, if you're middle 
class, you're going to eat a bag of dicks. We  
already understand that, right? is we used to 
have this massive social contract that protected  
the average guy. The average guy would have a, you 
know, he could get married, he could have a wife,  
he could have a stable job, he probably wasn't 
going to get exploited. And the thing you have to  
understand, your rights are maintained only to the 
extent that you collectivize. So back in the day,  
you know, there was collective pressure for the 
system to work in a certain way. We decided to  
remove that pressure. Look, that's fine. that 
pressure is gone. But we have to acknowledge  
that that collective pressure is gone. We've just 
laid back and said, "You can just do whatever you  
want. Okay, we'll eat the bag of dicks." We've 
made that choice. So, because that's where we are,  
we have to recognize that we don't have that 
collective help anymore. So, we have to be very  
individually aware of what actions that it is that 
we're taking. Right? When you have a collective  
group that says, "Okay, look, like we're not going 
to put up with this [ __ ] and we're going to  
lay down a proper frame here collectively." 
Well, then, you know, you're probably going  
to have a wife. You're you're going to have like, 
you know, a basic level middle- class job that's  
going to take care of you. You're going to have 
a good social contract. You know, you'll have a,  
you know, maybe good price for a doctor or things 
like that. But you have to understand that life  
and society, the way that it's built is always 
pressure and counter pressure. Okay? It's almost  
like a big thing of water and there has to be 
something like a bowl to contain that water.  
But if you just crack the bowl, you say, "Look, 
we don't care. It's less a fair. Anything goes."  
They're going to keep pushing and pushing and 
pushing and pushing. They will push indefinitely.  
Let let me tell you a couple stories, okay? How 
I learned about stuff like this. I don't mean to  
vent, but I think it's valuable to share these 
stories. Yeah. I had a um employee once that was  
a cameraman. I actually love this guy to death. I 
really love the guy uh on a person. I I like his  
personality, but not certain behaviors he has. So, 
I remember he used to work for me on the weekends  
and I thought he was getting paid, I don't know, 
maybe two grand a month or something, you know,  
maybe just working the odd weekend. And this was 
back in the day. And I said to him, I said, "Hey,  
bro. Why don't you work during the weekdays and 
you can make more money? I want I don't want you  
to make like 2 to 4K a month. Like, you know, 
I want you to be making, you know, maybe 10,  
15K a month. Like, let's just work just let's just 
work together like 5 days a week or something. You  
know, I like the work we're doing together." 
And he goes, "Ah, nah, I'm good." And I said,  
"Bro, how do you even get money? Like, why why 
don't you take the opportunity?" He's like, "Nah,  
I'm chill. I'm good." Well, what I found out with 
was the guy that I trusted to manage the business  
was lazy as [ __ ] Okay. He was just a dumb 
[ __ ] And so I wasn't putting pressure on him,  
which made him get lazy as a dumb [ __ ] And then 
this cameraman, who I love to death, helped me a  
lot. He was billing, I looked at it by the end, a 
h 100red hours a week billing my company. Okay, so  
here's how it happened. He's probably working the 
weekends and he thought, I'll bill an extra hour,  
they won't find out. Which is not wrong. You can 
have the hour, man. I don't care. I love the guy.  
Take a little more even. I love you, bro. Do what 
you want to do. Okay. Then when he realized no one  
saw it. So then he probably pushed a little 
further and he realized no one saw it. Then  
he pushed a little further and he realized no one 
saw it. And he basically did what all human beings  
will do, which is which is by the end he pushed 
it to a 100 hours a week. What do you need to do  
times seven to get 100 hours? Is that what is that 
about 13* 7 or something? What is 100? What is 100  
divided by 7? What is that? Anyone know? I think 
that's close. Yeah. So, he basically was saying  
that the guy's basically [ __ ] saying he's 
working 13 hours a day, but he's only working  
weekends. He's working about 4 days a month. Okay. 
About eight hours on those four days a month. But  
he's working now. He's working 13 hours a day. 
Okay. I look I had this one house. If you know LA,  
anyone here ever hiked Ren Canyon LA? Okay. Well, 
if you ever hike Running Canyon LA, there's this  
huge house. It's called the Runion House at the 
top of Renan Canyon. Okay. And I rented out that  
house. It's probably the biggest house in the 
entire Hollywood Hills. So, I rent that out,  
right? And my buddy, he was my personal train. 
Look, I again, I love I love people, right? So,  
even the people that [ __ ] me, I love them 
anyway, but they they can they put their dick  
in my ass. I'm like, I love you, bro, but can 
you take it out? So, so I remember he was like,  
"Hey," he's like, "Hey, man, you know, if I train 
you, can I have a room at your crib?" I said, "Uh,  
take the room. No problem." So, he takes the room. 
So then um he later says to me, "Could I have a  
friend stay over?" I said, "Sure, I have a friend 
stay over." He later said, "Could I have another  
friend stay over?" I said, "Sure, I have another 
friend stay over." Eventually, I think there's  
like six or seven people over. Now, I left for 
the month. So, I leave for the month and he called  
me a couple more times. Can I have this friend 
over? Well, by the end of it, my buddy, you guys  
know Jeff, okay, for my team, right? So, Jeff, 
he he calls me up. He goes, "Bro," he's like,  
"Your house is a [ __ ] refugee camp. There's 
people sleeping on the [ __ ] pool table. There's  
people sleeping around on the [ __ ] pool table. 
There's everywhere." Why? because he probably had  
the one guy, then the next guy, then the next guy, 
then the next guy, and he realized there's no push  
back and his brain rationalized it. And eventually 
he just decided to turn my mansion a refugee camp  
and they probably started inviting their own 
people cuz they realized there was no Yeah, it  
was an actual refugee camp. So basically my house 
was like a like a like a Haitian refugee camp. So  
what damage on that? Like how how expensive was 
that to like I don't I don't know because back  
then I was making so much cash I didn't keep 
track of my cash. But but the point that I'm  
making is this. Yeah, my time would be worth more 
than tracking the cash. But the point that I'm  
saying is that people will just continue to push 
to what they can get away with. So because the  
because the middle class and guys no longer have 
any kind of push back, basically they'll just push  
it further and further and further and further and 
further and further. Look, if you're a guy, right,  
and you got married back in the day, maybe you got 
married, you know, maybe your wife was 22, 23, 24,  
something like that, right? Now, you're going to 
financially take care of her uh through her 30s,  
her 40s, her 50s, her 60s, her 70s, her 80s, maybe 
her 90s, right? But you always had that memory  
like, you know, we were together back when she was 
22, and so, you know, I take care of her now, but  
we're together back when we're 22. Now, you think 
the average girl is looking to get married at at  
22? No. Because she knows that that same dude is 
gonna marry her at 38, and you'll probably marry  
her at 44. Okay? maybe squeeze one kid in, just 
get in one kid. And now that guy, he maybe got,  
you know, one kid out of it, and then he's going 
to pay, he's going to throw down cash for the 40s,  
50s, 60s, 70s, 80s, maybe 90s. That six decades 
he's going to throw down cash for, but he couldn't  
even get that first little couple decades because 
there's no collective pressure anymore, right,  
for maybe a girl to get married young. I'm not 
even saying that there should be, but I because  
that's a personal decision. I'm not trying to 
impose my values on you. I'm not even sure what my  
exact opinion is on that because I'm frankly the 
beneficiary of that system. Okay. I benefit from  
all the regular guys getting screwed over, which 
I hate. I I I benefit while hating it. I benefit  
while yelling at all of them to do better. Okay. 
I'm like, what the [ __ ] are you letting happen?  
But I you know, it's like you're living in a u in 
a an impoverished country and everybody's broke  
and then you decide to build a business and you're 
a billionaire and you're like, do you guys want to  
work? Like you guys should work. This is I don't 
like I' I'd rather I'd rather not be a billionaire  
and for all of you to have money so I could live 
in a better society. I don't want I don't want to  
be rich but live in a [ __ ] society. I don't want 
to be um enjoying the fruits of having an amazing  
we'll call it social skill set even though I enjoy 
the fruits of that. I'd rather that all y'all just  
got married, okay? And that marriage was even 
a thing that you could trust and wasn't just a  
flex on Instagram and wasn't just a way for you 
to get screwed financially. that marriage is a  
real thing. I'd like to see that go back. But in 
the meantime, if it won't and the system is what  
it is, and the guys just don't seem to care, the 
guys clearly don't care. They don't care enough  
to do anything. Then I guess I just work within 
the system that I know. I mean, they don't care,  
right? Clearly, they don't care. Like, I didn't 
care what he was billing 13 hours a day. I mean,  
I cared, but now I don't have to do anything 
about it. Not enough to check. You guys see what  
I'm saying here? So, what's that? What do you I 
mean I get this is probably a big question so it's  
probably like you can only do a short answer but 
what do you think got us to the point where guys  
are so complacent as a society like why did we get 
to this point that would be a big answer I could  
give you all the answer but that's a very very big 
answer but clearly they don't give a [ __ ] okay  
they're clearly so adapted to losing that they 
don't give a [ __ ] so as a result of that you've  
got to understand if you're in the middle like 
back in the day in the middle class like in the  
same way you're a middle you're you're a mid guy 
you had a nice wife waiting. You don't anymore.  
If you if you had a middle- class job, you had a 
retirement plan, you were going to get randomly  
fired halfway through your career, you didn't 
have to be, you know, dodging and weaving all  
the time just to maintain a middle class job. Now, 
they don't care because there's no push back. So,  
they'll push it and push it and push it and 
push it. If you guys even understand how most  
businesses run, they do split testing, right? They 
say, "If we raise the price a bit more, do we make  
more money?" Oh, we did. Okay. Raise a little 
more. Do we make more money? Okay, we did. raise  
a little more. Okay, we made more money. We did. 
Then they start shrinking the product quality,  
take a little out of the qu product, take a little 
out of it. And they're testing the elasticity of  
the market. Well, every single social system that 
you live in is like that. They're they test it  
to see when you're going to give push back. 
And as long as you don't, it will get worse  
and worse. Well, for the average mid guy at this 
point, the situation is so bad they've now split  
test lockdowns and people didn't care. So, if no 
one even cares that you got put on house arrest,  
they don't even care that you're being poisoned 
in the food system, you don't even care about  
the [ __ ] up education system, you don't care 
that marriage has gone to [ __ ] you don't care  
about the fact that you can't even just trust the 
system to give you a good job or retirement plan,  
you don't you can't even trust the government 
not to inflate the [ __ ] currency. You don't  
care about any of it. You don't care. Okay. No, 
no, but but I do care. No, you don't. What did  
you do? You didn't do anything. People will say 
like, "I like your like older content. We just  
said whatever you want." And I'm like, "But what 
did you do to ensure a reality where I could where  
I could open my mouth like that?" You didn't 
do anything. So then you allowed a system to  
exist where I had to be a bit more filtered. 
You created that system. I as one person did  
everything I could and worked around the clock 
and single-handedly helped that. By the way, a lot  
of you guys don't even know. You don't even know. 
By the way, I singlehandedly helped a lot of that  
stuff with a a number of other key big players. I 
got that handled for y'all. But y'all did nothing  
and just complain and go, you should just like 
ruin your own life for my entertainment, okay?  
You don't do [ __ ] So, I don't I don't know. It's 
just that's just kind of how life is, right? So,  
the point is is that because you and and it's 
you personally. You should view it like it's you  
personally. Allow the situation to get to what it 
is. You are no longer in a situation. You can be  
a mid guy. You are no longer in a situation that 
you can take L's. You just can't. Look, here be  
like another simple example. Antibiotics. What's 
Is there any doctors here that could explain this?  
Cuz I'm not a doctor. I don't want to give medical 
advice. Okay. Any doctors in here? Okay. So,  
what could you share about antibiotics and how 
effective they used to be and how effective they  
are now as a doctor? So, I'm not I'm not giving 
medical advice. I'm I'm allowing a doctor to say  
to share some medical information. Yeah. When 
antibiotics first arose back in the 1940s, they  
were pretty effective and they were used fairly 
judiciously when they were absolutely needed. Uh  
but due to a variety of reasons, they've been way 
overused and way abused and now we got all kinds  
of resistance and uh yeah, it's a big problem. 
Yeah. So, what kind of antibiotic like back in  
the day you added more effective antibiotics? What 
what types of antibiotics you use now like cypro  
and things like that? Yeah, there's been all kinds 
of newer generations of antibiotics that have had  
to be developed because of the overuse and uh 
the mislication just like every almost every  
type of medication is way overused and uh yeah so 
there's all kinds of newer generations and yeah  
now are they now the now not to jump over you 
but what I've heard is that and I don't know if  
this is true I'm just saying that I heard this 
that they're not even as effective as the old  
ones like they actually hit the system harder and 
that they're beginning to run out of pathways to  
create antibodies. I don't know if you've heard 
about that or if you're upset. Yeah, absolutely.  
Uh our emergency rooms are seeing all kinds of 
uh breakthrough diseases that are you know have  
we can't even treat them a lot of them um you know 
some of the newer ones. Uh so yeah, there's a ton  
of resistance and it's becoming a problem um in 
many ways. Yeah. So thank you for sharing that.  
And by the way um I remember I read this article 
when I was younger and it basically said that  
given that that now again I'm not giving medical 
advice. I'm just sharing some things that I heard.  
Not giving medical advice here. I'm not an expert. 
I'm not trying to frame myself as like this is not  
a medical conference. I'm wearing a flamboyant 
red shirt. I'm clearly not representing myself  
as a doctor. Go ask a doctor. I asked a doctor. 
Go ask a doctor. I'm not giving medical advice.  
But I remember okay not giving medical advice. But 
I remember just as a personal opinion. I I read  
that basically if antibiotics stop working, the 
only option you have is basically just don't get  
sick. You just can't get sick anymore. You're just 
not allowed to get sick anymore. So I studied. I  
learned from the best mentors. I read the best 
books. I split test different things. And again,  
I'm not teaching my methods on this cuz I'm just 
saying can only say what worked for me. And I  
didn't get six since 2012. So I said, I'm just 
that's just not a thing anymore. I don't trust  
the system to protect me. So I'm just not going to 
get sick. Now when I destroyed my leg, I did trust  
the system to fix my leg. I don't think my little 
[ __ ] jinseng route is going to take my exploded  
leg and rec re recon re like recon sorry yeah like 
it's not going to like reconstituate like my leg  
like pull it back alltogether cuz I took a reishi 
mushroom or something you know I got a optimal  
vitamin D intake I understand that so I go see a 
doctor at that point they're very very good at the  
reactive part but what I'm saying is I understood 
that these systems that are put in place currently  
are not able to be trusted Um, likewise, I mean, 
if if you want to even go a little bit deeper,  
because I because I could I saw what happened 
back in the day with Julian and I saw the [ __ ]  
that they said. So, as a as a result of that, 
I realized I couldn't trust the news. Okay,  
I could. Now, when Julian said like, you know, he 
could do a little better, I think he meant it. Um,  
in the sense that he could always do better, 
but they also lied about him profusely. Okay,  
so when he apologized sincere, but he also 
they also made up a lot of lies about him.  
So when I just saw the extent to which they 
lied, I realized I cannot trust uh the media  
to just give me the correct information because 
they didn't care. Now, by the way, why does the  
media also sometimes give false information? 
Any any guess on why? I just explained it.
Because does anybody only more recently with Trump 
and people like Tim P and others do you now see  
some blowback on the mainstream media? But up 
until maybe the mid2010s, was there any blowback  
on the media if they just attacked people or made 
up lies? There was no blowback whatsoever. So,  
as a result, trust in the media is at an all-time 
low. Now, what the mainstream media would say is  
that there's meant to be proper institutions who 
are held accountable, who are real professionals  
that give the data, not some random quack on the 
internet. Okay, I kind of think that's pretty  
fair. I think that's a fair statement when 
they say that. I get it. But if that's true,  
then maybe y'all need to stop being so [ __ ] 
partisan and maybe y'all need to start telling the  
[ __ ] truth. But they don't do that. So people's 
only recourse at that point is to go to other  
individuals. Now, in my case, because I had such 
low trust in the media, I took it upon myself to  
go make friends with people inside the government 
and inside of major institutions and have an  
inside track on almost everything because I just 
couldn't trust the freaking media. Why should  
I even have to do that? Why can't I just read a 
[ __ ] newspaper and get the information? Why have  
to like make all these [ __ ] phone calls and get 
to know all these different people and figure out  
what's going on? All this [ __ ] And that's why a 
lot of the time you guys will hear me saying like,  
"Guys, just trust me on this. Like, I know the 
inside scoop and then I can't say exactly what is  
or name names." I'll kind of just nudge that. And 
it doesn't mean that you should believe me 100%.  
I'm not saying that it is. But what I'm getting 
at is that I took it upon myself to find the  
inside track on a lot of different world issues so 
that I could understand them better. This was very  
very important. So I want to have plugs inside 
the White House, plugs inside major businesses,  
plugs inside municipal government, plugs inside 
um plugs inside fire station, police station,  
everywhere. I want to know people in these 
places so that if ever I have a question,  
there's people who I can give a phone call to. I 
want to build out networks where I can make phone  
calls and actually figure out what the [ __ ] is 
going on, right? I want to know about antibiotics,  
I can ask my friend Eric, right? Like, and I 
want to have thousands of people like that in  
my network. Okay? Thousands of people like that. 
Likewise, you know, we talk about how, you know,  
guys will say, "Oh, girls are a little too crazy 
these days." Okay, so you're saying girls a little  
too crazy. Okay, fair enough. That's fine. Take 
that opinion. That's fine. Well, show me the 500  
women that you're friends with. Show me your 500 
female friends. You don't have 500 female friends.  
Why don't you have 500 female friends? Because you 
didn't take it upon yourself to do so. Even like  
modern women's a [ __ ] and like all that stuff. 
Yeah, but nothing's stopping you from making  
friends with with 500 or a thousand of them. It's 
not that hard to just put on little parties and  
events and know all of them. You can do that 
within about 90 days, okay, to be acquainted  
with them. So, you didn't do that, right? So, now 
you're telling me that out of a pool of a thousand  
women, you couldn't find one who's a good girl. 
You couldn't find one that's half decent. doesn't  
mean they couldn't flip later, but you catch my 
point. So, you're not actually taking the real  
action on it, right? But look, here's the truth. 
Back in the day, you could not meet a thousand  
women and you'd probably meet a pretty good girl 
at your school, probably meet a pretty good girl  
at your work. In in a modern day, the system has 
changed because we allowed it to change. Okay? So  
now in effect what you know what you're looking 
at is if you're somebody who genuinely believes  
in social change then pick one issue one issue 
that you believe in educate yourself thoroughly  
and look at counter opinions don't just look 
at only your opinion look at counter opinions  
in case you're wrong look to falsify your own data 
pick one issue and spend the next 50 years working  
on it you know you spend 50 years working on one 
issue only real action and you might get a little  
bit of movement on that issue and contribute to 
a bit of movement on that issue. But, you know,  
if you're real smart, you got big networks, maybe 
you go further. But for the most part, if you make  
yourself strong and powerful, you can also have 
even more influence. But while you can take action  
on that one issue, if you're passionate about it 
and and you've tried to falsify the information,  
so on so forth, you also have to adapt to the 
modern situation of life now. Which means that  
if the antibiotics are having a problem, don't 
let yourself get sick. You know, if if it's if  
there's a problem in the dating pool, make sure 
that you're really really good at meeting a lot  
of people, make sure that you have a web of high 
of highle people. Okay? In fact, let me give tell  
you the truth. If I trusted any of you thoroughly 
enough and you said, "I I want to have a family,  
I could introduce you to your wife by next 
week." If I knew you and if I trusted you,  
I could introduce you to your wife by next week. 
Why is it that I could introduce you to your wife  
by next week? Take a guess. Your network. I have 
a network now. Do I have a network of just random  
party hoes? Actually, I do. Yeah. But okay. But um 
so I have a So predominantly about 98% to 99% of  
my network is basically just girls gone nuts. 
But the point is this. I love them to death,  
but they're nuts. But what's that? You also 
introduce us to the party host. Yes. But I mean,  
just, you know, come to the party sometime, 
right? But the point that I'm making, okay,  
I use the word hoes loosely saying women watching 
this guy. No, I'm not a hoe. But the point that  
I'm saying is this. Um, I I I'm I'm going to find 
those diamonds in the rough. And And I remember it  
was actually my buddy Tai Lopez that um inspired 
me on this back in the day. I'd already been doing  
it to a decent. Somebody really put in my head. He 
said, "Owen, because I remember I'd hang out with  
Tai and he would always have these like incredible 
female friends, like amazing female friends, like  
marriageworthy female friends. Not that I believe 
you get married in this day and age. I believe in  
marriage, but the old marriage, not the current 
marriage, but massively believe in marriage,  
but not this one, not this version." Okay. Neocons 
that try to influence you like just get married,  
just get married. That is very dangerous because 
they're correct that um marriage within a society  
is better for society. are right about that 
and they're right that it makes the most people  
happier, but they're wrong that the average person 
in this day and age is even is even mature enough  
to get married and they're wrong that there's 
even enough qualified people to even find that  
you can get married too and they're wrong about 
the legalities around marriage currently that  
make it often destined to fail. So, it's not 
they're they're right, but they're wrong at  
the same time. There's they're right of a from a 
previous society. And I think what they think is  
that if they just tell everyone to get married, 
maybe everyone will just do it and society will  
go back to normal. No, there's issues that we 
have to address to get it back there. We can  
get it back there, but there's issues that have 
to be addressed to get it back there. Including,  
by the way, some of the things that women 
fought for in feminism are legitimate. Some  
are legitimate. Maybe a girl doesn't want to just 
get married and pump full of babies by a [ __ ]  
derper. How many guys do you meet on the street 
that you let if you're a woman you let impregnate  
you and have access to your [ __ ] bank account? 
How many guys on the street that you meet you do  
that with? So, they feel the same [ __ ] way. 
So, a lot of their grievance is true, too. So,  
so we've got to we've got a lot of conversations 
to have and a lot of institutional change and  
social change to even get back to where the 
conservatives even want to take it to. I think  
they're right about about what it should be, 
but they're underestimating what's needed to  
get to that point. It's like we want to get from 
this island to the mainland, but then it's like  
just jump in the water. Jump in the water. It's 
like no, no, I want to get to the mainland, too,  
but we got to build a little boat. We got to got 
to get a little flutterboard, maybe a life jacket,  
maybe a [ __ ] sail. Like, don't just send 
everyone in into the water to drown. Okay?  
There's we there's we we want to get to the 
mainland, you know, we've been dumped on this  
[ __ ] island. We want to get to the mainland, 
but we're not going to get there by just jumping  
in the [ __ ] water. There's real changes that 
have to get made and we got to prepare. And  
there's a lot a lot of conversations we could have 
about that. What I'm getting at though is if I  
understand that it's not like we just live in our 
little farmer's village back in the day and little  
Suzie was brought up in the church and brought up 
with good values that most society's values are  
corrupt and I understand that. How do I deal with 
that? Do I complain about it on the internet and  
that's the extent of what I do? I'll address it on 
the internet. You know, I'm saying, "Hey, let's we  
want to get the boat over there. I'll address it 
so that we build a boat." That's not negative, by  
the way. But I still want to get over there. So, 
how do I address it? Well, think about it, right?  
I said that I don't trust the media. How do I fix 
that? I don't trust the media. How do I fix that?  
I went and got the inside scoop in every area 
that I want to know information. I I made I built  
relationships with the real people. If there's 
a problem with the quality of the people that  
you could have as a potential mate, how do you 
address that issue? I remember Ty said to me,  
he said, "Owen," I said, "Ty, how do you all 
these incredible female friends?" Like I would  
literally I'd literally like metaphorically wife 
up like 90% of every female friend you have. Like  
they're incredible. said, "Owen, have a habit of 
having great female friends. Always have 20 to 50  
incredible female friends that you treat amazing." 
Okay? You treat them incredible. And and because  
you treat them incredible, they you you want to 
treat them really, really, really good so that you  
can introduce your friends to these girls. Okay? 
So, you've got a bunch of female friends that you  
that you can introduce to the girls and then and 
and you just treat them freaking amazing and you  
and you don't hit on them, right? And then later 
if you wanted to turn it romantic because don't  
waste it on a hookup. Does that make sense? You 
don't waste it on a hookup. So later now as that  
girl becomes friends with you and she sees you 
as the coolest guy in the entire world, could you  
turn it romantic if you put your mind to it? Are 
you in the friendship zone when you're operating  
at that kind of level? You know, all these women, 
you're never in the friendship zone. But the point  
is is that you have a you're genuinely friends, 
which means that you should always have a network  
of 50 to 100 very high quality women that you 
invite out to that you invite out to events. Okay?  
So, that's like that's kind of what I'm getting 
at. Like you want you want to have stuff like that  
all the time. Okay. Hi there. Hi there. Okay. I'm 
at a seminar right now. Okay. So, I was explaining  
to them what it's like to have female friends. 
Okay. Yeah. You ready to help me? Um, I'll try.  
Okay. All right. So, what is it like? And you 
can tell them anything. How do I treat you as a  
female friend? How do I treat you? Um, you're very 
respectful, very like you're basically yourself, I  
feel like. Um, but you're very generous, very, you 
know, you we could get food, you pay for my food.  
Um, you're very like I don't I would just say 
you're very like you're very helpful, respectful,  
um, funny yourself. Like you'll just you'll talk 
you'll kind of like talk about stuff to me that  
I feel like you would talk about with your, you 
know, male friends. Like you don't really like  
filter what you're saying, but you're respectful 
and like Yeah. Now, this is amazing. I should have  
asked you this sooner now. Okay. Now, now, how do 
you think I benefit from you being my friend if  
we're at a party together, for example? What does 
that do for me and my romantic prospects? Well,  
um I think that if you are like around girls, then 
girls are going to feel more comfortable around  
you. Like automatically their guard is going to 
go down if they see you're with a girl because  
they're going to be like, "Oh, like he's cool. 
So like he already has female friends. So like  
he must be So like that initial guard that they 
might have around you is going to like already be  
dropped. So you're already going in in like a way 
better you're already like entering the you know  
dynamic in a way better place because they don't 
their guard is already going down when they see  
you have other girlfriends. That's really good. 
Like I think I I like what you said too, that  
one that where you were like, "Yeah, you know, if 
you have pretty female, like, you know, looks are  
subjective and everything like that, but if you 
have pretty female friends, like you can kind of  
get those kinds of girls." Yeah. Basically, if 
you have a girl that looks like that with you  
as your friend, that automatically qualifies 
you. And then what is as as my friend, what  
are some things that I do, like maybe inviting 
you to things or things like that that you get  
out of it having a guy friend? Because I think 
a lot of the guys here don't understand that.  
Oh, like I mean so much like parties, um cool 
like me introducing me to other cool girlfriends,  
um self-development stuff, uh just other like cool 
stuff to do. Um yeah, cuz you have like you know a  
lot of people and do a lot of cool things. So it's 
just cool to be invited to those things and hang  
out and meet cool people. And then look how cool I 
look now, guys. See that? Right. Okay. Okay. Thank  
you. Okay, I'll call you later. Okay, that was 
amazing. Okay. Yeah, absolutely. Have fun. Okay.  
I'll see you later. Okay. See you later. Bye. 
Bye. Okay. So, you guys see what I'm saying here,  
right? So, you should always have 20 to 50 of 
those. Okay. Does she sound like some cracked  
out modern woman ready to like jump on the 
[ __ ] carousel and do a bunch of coke? No.  
No. She's highly intelligent, super beautiful, 
amazing, marriage quality woman. I think she's  
been with with like two guys or something like 
that. So that's what I'm getting at, right? Like  
you always want to know uh many many girls like 
that that are your friends and then what happens  
is you know you want to go to a party, you want to 
like the thing is is that when I say that I could  
introduce one of you guys to your next wifey. 
I could introduce you to her but we're really  
friends now. She trusts me to whatever extent that 
I'm not going to introduce her to a [ __ ] scrub,  
right? So I'd have to know that you're actually 
serious about wanting a relationship but I'd also  
have to know you're not a [ __ ] derper. So, I've 
had guys that have come on my trainings and then  
they'll say things like like I'll mention that I 
could help them find their wifey and they're like,  
"Look, man, I've just realized that this is all 
just too hard and you know, I just want to get  
married and have a family." I'm like, first of 
all, she's very very nice to me, but because  
she's a high level woman, she will [ __ ] test. 
Oh, wait, but is that a low quality woman who who  
[ __ ] [ __ ] tests? Every woman [ __ ] tests. The 
higher quality the woman, the more likely she is  
to [ __ ] test. It sucks when you're in love with 
a girl and then she goes a little nuclear on you,  
but that's called life. So women women who have 
options at some point are going to [ __ ] test  
you and you have to be indifferent to it and you 
have to be so grounded in your own path it doesn't  
bother you. But do you guys see what I'm saying? 
How the average guy gets [ __ ] in the ass,  
the average guy eats a bag of dicks, he literally 
can't even find one girl to have kids with. No,  
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. 
What you do is you find 50 girls that you could  
have a kid with if you or kids with if you want 
to children with and then you make friends with  
them and then you find other guys that also have 
a lot of female friends and what you do is you  
guys make friends with each other. So you also 
better believe that back that in LA I know a lot  
of amazing people but also I make friends with the 
guys who also know amazing people. So when we're  
out, you know, we might be out at like the Rosé 
day in LA or something like that, right? It's like  
a beautiful party, super upscale. Helicopters go 
over and they dump roses on. It's awesome, right?  
And I'll know the other guys in LA that also have 
a lot of female friends. And I'll know that I'll  
know because I'll see them over in the corner 
and they're surrounded by women. And then I'll go  
over, they already know who I am because probably 
a lot of their female friends know me and mention  
me to them. I'll go over and I treat those guys 
like gold. I treat them like gold. What dinner  
can I take you to? What party can I invite you 
to? I'll let them come to a party. Even if they  
don't bring any girls, I don't care because I know 
that they know a ton of people. So rather than me  
just accepting the status quo, I understand that 
the status quo for a man in this day and age is a  
big bag of dicks. It's a big giant L. And we're 
not allowed to have an L in this day and age.  
If you take an L in this day and age, you are 
[ __ ] Or in this case, you're not [ __ ] So,  
okay. So, so I understand that. So I'm always 
So basically what you guys have to understand  
is that society has moved to massive amounts of 
individual self-development and it's moved in that  
direction specifically because the system is not 
protecting us anymore. And it may get back there  
or it may not. Usually what it takes is that a 
group has to be has to get [ __ ] on for about  
50 years until they eventually wake up and they 
say never again and then they collectivize and  
then usually what happens that they do things to 
look out for their interests but they go way too  
far. They go way too [ __ ] far. So they initially 
get public empathy and then eventually they just  
become [ __ ] annoying because they can't stop and 
they make it their job to complain all the [ __ ]  
time and then that just ruins it for everybody 
for for that group and then eventually people  
lose empathy for them. But usually they've made 
usually what happens, they make a lot of progress  
and then some of that progress gets rolled back 
because they don't know when to shut the [ __ ]  
up and just take the win and stop complaining all 
the [ __ ] time. So eventually guys will probably  
do that and that's fine. But in the meantime, 
unless you're like and even if you even if you  
started something like that today, which you 
get [ __ ] on in ways that you don't even know,  
I promise you you would go to hell and back to 
do it. Um it still wouldn't fix the fact that  
your situation's [ __ ] So yes, you want to make 
change. Sure, make change in whatever area that  
you want to make change. But you've also got to 
recognize the toxicity and the damage that our  
basic level environment has taken. And then you've 
got to actively look for solutions for that. Okay.  
Um can I give you guys another one? Want another 
one? Yeah. Um what'll happen if you just allow  
your children to get raised in the current modern 
society as far as what's going to brainwash them?  
They're [ __ ] They're super [ __ ] right now. 
Have you guys seen what these tablets and screen  
time and shit's doing to these kids' heads? It's 
disgusting. It's [ __ ] them up super bad, right?  
They're living more through a phone or a tablet or 
a computer than real life. So, do any of you guys,  
if you kind of follow maybe my Instagram story, 
have any sense of what I did to fight back against  
that? Mhm. What I do? I mean, you're taking your 
kids all over the [ __ ] country, taking them out  
in the nature, you know, get pushing them to do 
[ __ ] you know? You know, you had up here running  
seminars and [ __ ] like Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I've my 
kids have hiked uh the Calala trail all 11 miles  
in the coast. My kids have hiked Eagle Creek. Any 
you guys ever hiked Eagle Creek around here? Go  
down to Oregon and hike Eagle Creek. It's amazing. 
It's so good. It's so incredible. So, my kids just  
hiked Silver Falls this past week. Um my kids have 
hiked into Bissy Badlands overnight. Um you know,  
they they're I've got I've got them out skiing. 
They've been to almost every major national park.  
That's a lot of national parks, guys. Uh they've 
been to almost every city, almost every zoo in the  
country. The last major zoo they haven't been to 
is Omaha, which is actually the biggest one in the  
country. I'm driving to [ __ ] Omaha. What kind 
of dad takes their kids to [ __ ] Nebraska? Right.  
Someone from Nebraska's wife's like, "Hey." 
But yeah, there's a big zoo in Nebraska. So,  
what I did for for the summer tour when I what I

Okay. Okay. Thank you. [ __ ] sick, dude. That's 
my kid's summer. Yeah. Yeah. They think that's  
reality. You talking about this [ __ ] last year 
at last year's pre-our made me be like, why am  
I not going on all of these hikes and [ __ ] 
I just went on Reneer last [ __ ] week, like  
last Thursday before last, and it was a beautiful, 
transcendent experience. So, I just want to thank  
you for inspiring me to actually take advantage 
of all the natural beauty in this state, you know,  
cuz I'm not in a position where I can travel the 
[ __ ] country, but there's so many cool trails  
in Washington. If you live here, go experience 
that [ __ ] It's [ __ ] awesome. It really is.  
Yeah. And take people that you like with like take 
fun people that you enjoy spending time with with  
you. And I promise you, it is better than anything 
you could ever experience through a screen. Yeah.  
Thank you. Give a hand for that, guys. And 
by the way, that's real rich people [ __ ]  
That's real rich people [ __ ] because I'm telling 
you there's there's not really a lot that you can  
buy with money. Like one of the good things that 
the middle class does have is the national park  
system. And by the way, one thing that I'll say 
to you is while it can be costly to do it, get  
find a way to do it. Like back in the day when I 
want to travel the world, I would sleep on floors,  
closets. I just got used to sleep on floors and 
couches and closets and [ __ ] And what you can do  
is you could actually get a you could get a tent, 
an air mattress, van life, and you could drive  
around and see this [ __ ] you know, maybe while 
building an online business or something like  
that. Like there's there's ways to be creative 
here, right? But do you guys see what I did to  
fight back against the tablet situation? Now, 
does that mean that my kids will grow up as like  
mega transcendent geniuses because I took them to 
National Park? Look, I don't know because I you  
never have complete control over your children's 
decisions. You just don't. But what I can control  
is I don't traumatize them. I'm super nice to 
them. I show them things. I just do the things  
that I can control. But do you guys see what I'm 
saying? that we understand that the parenting  
system is [ __ ] and that we've literally let 
all these computers in the house and so on and  
so forth. So, you've got to actively fight back. 
So, I understood I understood basically that look  
the the dating situation is out of control, total 
garbage, total trash, hypergamy, out of control,  
etc., etc. I knew that. So, I said, "Okay, I've 
got to learn how to approach people. I've got to  
learn how to put on parties. I've got to build a 
large female social circle." I understood that the  
health situation was out of control. So, I read 
every single natural health book, studied under  
experts, and then I went and I didn't get sick 
since 2012. I understood that I couldn't trust  
the media. So, I went and got uh plugs from inside 
the media. And you'll notice that I make a lot  
of predictions, including some pretty outlandish 
ones, and they always wind up coming true. Maybe  
someday one of them won't, but they always want 
the ones I've made have so far always come true.  
Probably I'll be wrong at some point, but you see 
what I'm saying here, right? I understood that the  
uh system as far as employment was super [ __ ] 
So, I said, "Okay, well, I've got to use cutting  
edge modern tools and I built an online business 
and I got really good at being a coach and  
producing results like I talked about for you. 
I can't remember your name again. Was it Casey?"  
Yeah. So, Casey, in the same way, you know, when 
working with a guy like yourself, how to produce  
results and I went out and I did it. I guess what 
I'm saying is, do you remember I said earlier  
that motivation's not even a thing. What I mean by 
that is that if you're struggling with motivation,  
you are going to eat a bag of dick so big you 
are going to get super [ __ ] on levels that  
you can't even [ __ ] imagine because this that 
system is gone. Okay, that system is gone. Now,  
is it good that the system is gone? No, I don't 
think so. But in every bad situation, there's  
also going to be some upside. So, while I think 
that that that is pretty [ __ ] that you literally  
have to go to these extreme legs to even get the 
basic deal that you would have got 50 years ago,  
nonetheless, there are some upsides. What are 
some upsides that maybe I got out of it? I mean,  
is my current life better than if I'd worked at 
the car factory in my 50s with my wife who's the  
looks equivalent of me? Yeah. Okay. So, what are 
some things that I got or that you could get out  
of the current system? So, again, I'm not saying 
that it's good. It's actually really [ __ ] where  
things have gone. But what could we get out of it? 
What are some things that we could benefit under  
under that kind of pressure? Because human beings 
do tend to to respond to pressure quite well if we  
step up to the pressure. I think a lot of us just 
don't even understand how bad it is. Yeah. You  
know, once you start thinking how bad it is, then 
you'll start stepping up to the pressure. I knew  
intuitively how bad it was. I could see it. That's 
one of the I saw what happened to my dad. I could  
see this stuff. That's one of the biggest benefits 
I've gotten from just consistently watching your  
content because like I mean, you know, it makes 
me look like a [ __ ] but I've struggled with  
that whole motivation thing at times. And 
I think that the biggest reason where that  
comes from is it's just short-term thinking of the 
complacency that comes from being more comfortable  
now than the initial pain that you have to 
put yourself into to build momentum. And so,  
you have to kind of like have the long-term vision 
to see where the trajectory is going and see the  
pain that you're going to incur if you keep doing 
the same [ __ ] and sort of like pull it from the  
future into now. Did you guys see Did you guys 
catch the key point of what he said there? You  
can have someone explain to you how [ __ ] things 
are without having to personally experience. And  
then from there, you can see if they're telling 
the truth or not. You can kind of use your your  
mind's capacity for abstraction and see if 
you think they're telling the truth. Okay. So,  
can I can I share with you taught with me? 
Yep. Share this. Thanks, bro. Okay. This guy,  
I showed up and he was on YouTube when I was 25. I 
was drinking. I was addicted to cocaine and I came  
sound like a good time. Oh, it came to like rock 
bottom. This guy called something 10 years later.  
Uh, so when I was 25, he made a call that when you 
get to 35, I look back, I dated the time you were  
37 at the time when you told this and you talked 
to me into the future and what you said to me,  
I actually actualize. Now, one of the things 
you said, it was one of your three-hour pieces  
of content. One of the things he said to me at 
25 was on YouTube was that when you get to 35,  
you're going to start to look around at the 
people and the friends that you used to be with.  
And you're going to say this. I'm going to say it 
exactly how you said. Car crash. Car crash. Okay,  
that's okay. Car crash. Car crash. And now 
I'm metaphorical. And now I'm 35. And it I  
actually see that with my friends and I've gone 
back. I've been out of my country in 8 years. I  
come back and seen the people that I know. And I 
stayed sober from that time of 25. and it actually  
actualized and I didn't have to go through that. 
You saved me 10 years on that. So, thank you.
Thank you, bro. Yeah. Thank you, man. Yeah. No, I 
mean because Yeah. It's just Yeah. You guys have  
to understand that like most of human history, 
the plebs are getting [ __ ] the elites are  
getting money, but it's also a constant state of 
war, right? So, there's this kind of like little  
period after World War II. There was even Vietnam, 
right? But there's a little period after World War  
II where things are relatively stable and then we 
tend to think that it's still the same as that.  
And and then it becomes that if you talk about 
how [ __ ] up things are, it it comes across as  
being negative. Um I'm not really someone for 
for positivity or negativity. I'm just someone  
for odyssey and then solving the problem. But you 
won't see me get stuck in complaining for a long  
period of time. So I like to make a video with a 
bit of complaining to just motivate so that people  
will wake up. But then from there, once you're 
awake, I want it to be 99% solutionsoriented. So  
for me, I'm just looking to solve problems. That's 
all that I'm thinking about. So here's what I'm  
kind of trying to point out to you guys. You want 
to think about the major areas in your life and  
then have an honest conversation with yourself. 
Is the system going to solve this for me? Like  
can I currently rely on the system to solve this 
for me? Now, by the way, um you know, I I want  
to kind of present some of the counterarguments 
on this. Okay? I think this is important. Okay.  
But I'm going to give my take too, and I'll try 
to steelman this rather than straw man it. I'm  
going to steal man the argument. So what some 
people would say is if you have an a societal  
institution and that institution is focused on 
bringing real professionals to solve problems,  
um you should trust them, right? You know, if 
you're going to get on a plane, you you know,  
you don't walk up to the pilot and say, "Get 
out the way. I'll fly this thing." Right? I'm  
the expert now. That would be an argument for 
trust authority or trust experts. Okay. Um,  
and I don't view anything as either or black or 
white. I think there's a lot of instances where  
you've got to trust the experts. Um, when I broke 
my leg, for example, I understood that my jinseng  
was not going to fix my leg. I understood that 
there's modern medicine that I've got to listen  
to what they tell me and do what they tell me. 
And look, look, the truth is there's probably  
even some better way that they haven't thought of 
in some other paradigm. I'm not saying otherwise.  
there always is, but unless I'm going to figure 
that out while I'm in the middle of an injury,  
I got to kind of work with what I got would 
be the best way I'd put it to you. Um, so,  
you know, sometimes you just got to trust the 
damn institution, right? There there's a lot of  
good institutions. There's people building roads 
and, you know, you you drive across the bridge and  
you hope that the damn institution work. So, I'm 
not trying to say that every single institution  
is garbage. I'm not saying that. But what I will 
tell you is that there's is that while a lot of  
institutions have a lot of good. You look at it 
say an academic institution like Harvard where  
they've been completely politicized. It's this 
like left-wing churning station. My some of my  
friends go there. I'd like to send my kids there. 
But I just look at it I'm like damn like this is  
I mean I could trust my kids there because my kids 
have such a good foundation. They're not going to  
get brainwashed. So they could just take it for 
the education and connections and whatnot. But  
um they've got an incredible foundation. I've 
I've taught my kids since they're three. Don't  
just listen to your teachers cart blanch. Like I 
teach my kids, you got to think for yourself. I've  
taught them that for years. But you know, when 
a top college is [ __ ] around at that level,  
man, that's [ __ ] crazy, bro. Like, that is 
just that's just [ __ ] insane. Um, you know,  
when you see what happened in 2020, you know, and 
they're they're doing this like all these little  
policies that they put in and stuff like that. 
That was kind of like the big unmasking, right?  
That was the big unmasking where where you know 
and and they took decades of institutional trust  
and trust in government and they pissed that 
away in about two years and the craziest part  
was that if anybody even spoke up about it they 
got muzzled. So So it's just completely crazy  
what happened. They they just destroyed decades 
of trust. I mean that was like the biggest eye  
opener for so many different people. I mean 
even when you're taking actual doctors and  
musling them and stuff like that. I mean is I 
mean it's just it's [ __ ] wild bro. So there,  
you know, and then and then you start to discover 
that a lot of these businesses that produce foods  
are putting chemicals in the foods and whether 
it's weird colorings or pesticides or things  
like that. Like like how come you can't just eat 
strawberries, guys? You know what I'm saying? Like  
how come you can't just go get some conventionally 
grown strawberries and just eat them? Okay, like  
shouldn't you say you got to eat the strawberries? 
Okay, so you know, so what the hell is going on  
there, right? In in LA, we have these fires. Guys, 
one of my houses almost got burned to the ground.  
The fire went right up to it. Right up to it. I'm 
not even kidding. And you know, and it's like,  
now to be fair, those firefighters kicked ass and 
they put out that fire. So that's amazing. But  
other people had entire neighborhoods wiped out. 
They find out that the the water's been turned off  
and things like that, right? The water's literally 
turned off. Meanwhile, you see Rick Caruso,  
the guy who was the competitor for the for the 
mayor of LA, who actually runs the who owns the  
Grove. He's this amazing businessman. And all of 
his uh properties in the palisades all survived  
cuz he was prepared. Damn. Yeah. He had private 
fire stations and all this stuff. It's just [ __ ]  
is different than the Bohemian Grove, right? Yeah. 
It's not the Bohemian Grove. No, I heard that one.  
I was like, "Wait, what?" Yeah. Connecting that 
with the Redwood maybe. But yeah. So So what I  
what No, the Grove Mall is like just like a really 
cool mall in LA. Kind of like your guys waterfront  
down here. Like just a nice area to hang out. 
And it's owned by Rick Caruso. And the optics  
on that are so crazy. Like literally his mall in 
the Palace is just completely survives the fire.  
This guy does not need the money. He went and 
tried to run to be mayor of LA and and he lost  
to Karen Bass and what happened was then the city 
burned down. Look, maybe it would have happened  
under his watch, too, but the optics of all his 
stuff surviving is just so freaking funny. Um,  
but you're literally watching the damn city 
burn down. It's [ __ ] crazy, bro. So, you know,  
we're all we're all told to uh you know, to to 
lock down and shelter in place and then there's  
all these crazy protests and somehow that's 
okay, but you can't keep your business alive  
and it's just crazy. Well, it's just a bunch of 
stuff like that where the institutional trust,  
people's entire businesses getting destroyed. 
I watch so many incredible businesses. Look,  
if you guys were in LA right now, I would tell 
you to go eat at night at Pacific Dining Carb,  
the best late night restaurant I've ever seen. 
That's completely bankrupt. Bankrupted. You can't  
go now. They got bankrupted. And there's so many 
other cool places that were just destroyed by what  
happened. So, what I'm getting at with you guys 
is while you can trust institutions to a degree,  
it's not black and white. You can you you're 
no longer in a position to trust institutions  
or the system blindly. You just can't. And I hope 
that we get back to where we could. But we're not  
able to right now. And that's because there's no 
longer push back. There's just not. So you guys  
have heard the expression strong people make 
good times. Good times make weak people. Weak  
people make bad times. Bad times make strong 
people. So we are at the end of that cycle to  
where all these like end of the empire things are 
beginning to happen. everything's going to [ __ ]  
and as a result we just have to be a lot more 
responsible. Okay. So, what are some good things  
under that kind of pressure that will happen 
because you're put under pressure like that?  
Cuz there is some positive action. Action. 
Yes. Well, let me give an example. I mean,  
if I could have just say, you know, met my high 
school sweetheart at 16, got married at 20. Um,  
would I have uh my friend who I just called on the 
phone? No. No. I wouldn't have that, right? Um,  
if I thought that antibiotics would save me, would 
I have learned everything I did about natural and  
not get sick since 2012? No. No. Okay. If I'd had 
a cushy job waiting for me and then I just would  
have worked at the car factory, would I have built 
this cool business that I have here where I have  
freedom and creativity and all these cool things 
I get to do? Would I have done that? No. Okay. Um,  
if I would have just simply accepted, okay, I'll 
have a wife who's kind of like at my level and  
paired off with her, would I have wound up dating 
famous models or actresses or all these other  
interesting girls that I've dated? Would that 
have happened? No. Okay. If my if I could have  
trusted my kids to maybe play in their local 
suburb with the other kids on the playground,  
would I have then would I have been as likely 
to take them to every zoo in the country? I  
probably would have done it, right? So, have you 
guys ever heard the expression, the enemy of the  
best is the good? M. Okay, repeat that after me. 
Say, the enemy of the best is the good. Okay,  
kind of I got to work on my little repeat things 
there. Tony Robbins, he's so good, man. Like I've  
been to Tony some he'll get the crowd to do the 
perfect chant. I'm always like everyone's like  
stumbling over each other. But I got to work on 
that. But but yeah, it's it's um a lot of this  
stuff can really motivate you. I mean, you know, 
if I would have not had to read as much as I did,  
I wouldn't have read as much as I did. So I think 
in a lot of ways a society that's a little bit  
[ __ ] up can also be very motivating for you 
to take a high degree of action. Now what I see  
this a lot of what I see is this though a lot of 
the view counts on videos if it's just straight  
uh bitching and moaning and complaining those 
videos tend to be very very high and they  
explode. But if it's a video that is very heavy on 
solutions what kind of distribution does that get?  
not very good. It's not very good. Right? Like 
for example, if I want to increase my view count,  
should I include more solutions and positivity, 
or should I complain, play victim, and just talk  
about how everything sucks and you're completely 
[ __ ] What would get up my view counts more? I  
mean, I should I should do a uh I should do a test 
like make like a like a like a fake video where  
I'm just like [ __ ] on everybody and everybody 
sucks and all that kind of stuff. 20 million. Oh,  
yeah. I mean like like my girl Mariah, she has a 
channel and she did this one about like horrible  
stories about guys and that blew up. There's this 
other thread they called like like the men of the  
year thing on Tik Tok where they just show stupid 
men and that's got a gazillion views. But will you  
ever see like the ones about good men? No. Very 
very unlikely. So the culture is shifting to a  
lot of complaining. I think that we can we we have 
to on one level yes recognize what's happening.  
I think a lot of the podcasters do a great job of 
just doing interviews where people just reveal how  
[ __ ] in the head they are. Like you guys ever 
seen these um podcasts where they'll just bring on  
a bunch of people and they'll talk about like how 
entitled they are and all their demands and just  
how completely delusional they are and they'll do 
like a cat calculator of how delusional they are  
and things like that. I think that's great as far 
as exposing uh the direction that society's gone,  
but I think that that's kind of like the first 
base, right? And we want to get to a home run. So  
do we want to get stuck at just complaining? No. 
So what do we So where do we want to take that to?  
Solutions. We want to take that into solutions. So 
we want to be very very very solutionoriented. So  
what I always tried to do the approach that I took 
was basically that I I always came from a mindset  
that you can solve almost any problem. I really 
believe that. I mean almost all of them. Not every  
problem but you can solve almost every problem. 
And I believe that you can solve most problems by  
just talking to a lot of people. Just talk. Just 
go talk to a lot of people. Like get obsessed with  
the problem. Talk to a lot of people. Go out and 
bring up the problem with a lot of people. Get a  
range of different opinions. You really can. You 
can get this enormous range of different opinions.  
If you go out and you talk to a lot of people, 
um, and then what winds up happening is that as  
time goes on, you start to get a sense of if those 
opinions are real. Start reading a lot of books,  
get mentors, create mastermind groups, and start 
to solve the issue. Right? Then what you do is you  
look for things that are massively high leverage 
like things that can just solve massive problems.  
So for example um you know with talking about 
you not being shy I hope that tomorrow by the  
end of tomorrow you fix that. I really do hope 
that you do. And the thing that I would say is  
um what we try to do is we try to apply the strong 
medicine. Say the word strong medicine. Strong  
medicine. Okay. So, in other words, what you're 
what you're looking for is people who have very  
intense, very hardcore, very outside the box, very 
proactive solutions to problems is fundamentally  
what you're looking for, right? And what you'll 
see is there's people out there that are okay to  
live in the cesspool and there's people out there 
who just aren't is fundamentally what you're going  
to see. Okay? There's people that are okay to live 
in the cess. They prefer it and people aren't.  
Yeah. A lot of people are just addicted on it. 
They prefer it. I have videos coming out that kind  
of address um why it gets sort of ingrained in the 
person like what happens and why it gets ingrained  
in them. Okay. Some people are okay to live in a 
cardboard box shooting up heroin and eating their  
own [ __ ] and giving a hand job to old man at the 
park for drugs. Um, some people are okay to be to  
to believe that it's okay to be middle class, 
to live in the system believing it's still the  
1950s and60s when you'd be taken care of when it's 
really not. And they lack a sense of urgency, but  
they're okay with it. And maybe they're not going 
to do heroin or crack. You know, I saw a guy just  
huffing crack on the street today. It was crazy. 
Um, maybe they don't do crack. Yeah. Welcome to  
Seattle. Yeah. But maybe they do a lot of Tik Tok. 
Maybe they just engage in a lot of diversions.  
Right. So that's your version of crack. Yeah. 
Okay. And you're like, "Oh, I don't do crack.  
I'm doing okay." Find the person who views your 
average lifestyle looking like a homeless person  
doing crack. Okay. Find someone like that. Yep. Uh 
I worked in a supportive housing site for a year  
and I watched these people like really destroy 
themselves. And then uh in that process I saw  
like my own version of that which is like I've 
got massive addiction to the phone. Uh oh yeah  
I could be I could be more specific but that's 
the So you were able to recognize those patterns  
by seeing people at the bottom. You were able to 
extrapolate those patterns into yourself even if  
it's not as bad so to speak but you were able to 
see the pattern. I uh I read Gabbor Mate's book  
your recommendation. Thank you. Good book by the 
way. Yeah. In the realm of hungry ghosts. Yeah. So  
I I I see that in myself so much. And then also 
like it it doesn't just stay small either. So  
like if you allow yourself to eat a small amount 
of garbage, you just kind of get more and more  
garbage and it just kind of it's like magnetic. 
Yeah, you get it, bro. Yeah. Thank you, bro. Thank  
you. Yeah. So I almost died. It's not like it's no 
joke. What happened? Uh you can't leave us hanging  
there. Here. Stand up for a sec. Stand up for a 
good hook. Yeah. Um, I um I I got I got really  
suicidal, but uh the way that it happened was that 
I uh man I it's it's a it was a long story. It's  
a long story, but uh I I did a bunch of drugs and 
uh tried to get better with women by sleeping with  
escorts and then that didn't work actually. Weird. 
Uh I got super depressed and then uh I was like in  
a a suicidal slump for better part of like half 
a year. I just stayed at my home and just jerked  
off and felt really sorry for myself and uh it 
was it was it was really bad. Well, I will say  
this on the positive side. I bet it was a hell 
of a party on the front end, right? There's some  
highlights. Yeah, I bet. There's there's there's 
some highlights. There's some stories. Like you  
did it for no reason. How did you get out of that 
place? Well, like the I I hit a wall. I was on uh  
I was on like Vivans and then I was also taking 
cocaine. So, it's like the one is like legal and  
like the right thing to do and the other one is 
like the wrong thing to do. And turns they're  
not that dissimilar in in my opinion. People 
could have their own perspective, but uh from  
my personal experience, I didn't find them that 
different, which was startling cuz it's supposed  
to be like, oh, you go get help from the doctor, 
not drugs from the doctor. And uh yeah. Yeah. And  
then uh I hit hit a wall where like even when I 
was having sex, I didn't enjoy it. Wow. Like like  
literally I'm here with someone having sex. They 
want to have sex with me. Uh it's I'm not paying  
for it and I just can't even enjoy the intimacy. 
I can't enjoy it. I just like walk around and like  
this sort of like dissociated like fugue state 
and just like eventually I I called my mom and I  
told her I was thinking about committing suicide 
and then uh I I moved back in with my mom at 35.  
So it's super cool, you know. Yeah. Do drugs and 
and stuff. Yeah. Give a hand, guys. It's awesome.
You made it. Yeah, I'm here. Thank you, bro. You 
are. And a lot of people don't. You know what,  
too? Is like Well, I wanted to thank you 
because I uh uh like in in that place,  
I actually did make it onto a Zoom call with you 
and uh I was like smoking handrolled cigarettes  
and drinking whiskey on the call, but like just 
disappearing off camera for that. Uh, but you  
uh talked about like going out into nature and 
like the psychological benefits and even though I  
was like in that really really depressed state and 
I didn't even think it would work. I'm like you  
said listen to David Sue [ __ ] So I'm listening 
to [ __ ] the Bible even though I've got like  
religious trauma but I'm like okay well [ __ ] try 
it. And then I started walking away from my house.  
So I'm just not in my house and then walking down 
the river by my house. And I explored more this  
summer of the area that I've lived for the last 
10 years than I than I ever did. And I was like,  
"Oh [ __ ] like this river connects to that 
place." Like, you know, [ __ ] like that  
where it's like I just didn't take the time to 
actually go out in nature. And for the first bit,  
it wasn't like it wasn't like I went into nature 
and it was like blinging, but it was like kind of  
like a really really slow positive returns. Yeah. 
And I I noticed that them starting to add up as  
I like spent more time. And uh then but the yeah 
when I finally got to the place where I was like I  
actually need to reach out to like someone I know 
cares about me instead of like fake friends or  
uh just watching stuff on the internet even your 
stuff which is great uh and and got me pointed  
in the right direction at least. It's still no 
replacement for like actual people that love you  
and so yeah. Yes it is. Daddy loves you. He's got 
Yeah. Yeah. No, thank you, bro. Give me a hand,  
guys. That's awesome. Yeah. Thank you, bro. 
Thank you, man. Yeah, that's amazing. You know,  
do you guys know each other from before? No, no, 
but I we're from Canada and we just met today,  
man. Well, if you guys start using again, 
you should just get back into it. No,  
you're supposed to. I I like to I just like to 
joke around, man. I don't think that serious. Yo,  
cuz like one of my ex-girlfriends, she she 
would work at at uh poker games during COVID  
and like oh yo, like talk about institutions, 
like all these like like literally like top  
political officials and policemen and all 
these people running the city would be at  
illegal poker games railing down cocaine and 
begging hookers at these things. Oh, major actors  
are at these things. It's [ __ ] crazy. She would 
go to she would go to this because uh she couldn't  
have a job during co but anyway she would tell me 
that's why I was bitching a lot of time too during  
lockdown because I'm literally hearing about all 
these major officials that are locking us down  
and out no mask doing coke banging hookers you 
know out of the legal poker game and meanwhile  
um and meanwhile everybody else is like losing 
their businesses right but anyway I remember she  
would tell me these stories how like these like 
rich guys would just like play poker and they just  
snort rails of coke and bang hookers and like 
I will never actually have that experience and  
I'll never do it. It's not something I'd ever do, 
but you got to admit that'd be a hell of a party.  
Like imagine you're just like you just blow away 
a4 million dollars in gambling to start banging a  
[ __ ] hooker on Coke. Like like I mean I will 
never have like I I can go to a national park  
with my kids. So I mean there's a reason people do 
it, right? Like let's not let's not pretend it's  
like you know but that's the problem is that it 
unfortunately burns down your brain. Yeah. No, I  
know you didn't. I'm saying it's not sustainable. 
Not sustainable. It's like if you take your credit  
card and just swipe it and swipe it and swipe 
it and swipe and you're [ __ ] There's no more  
happy chemicals in my brain. So even when I do 
positive [ __ ] it don't feel good about Yeah,  
that's a Yeah, could you I'm going to come back 
to him again for a second. But this is a big day.  
But like yeah, mention that cuz I think when so 
so give me one sec. So when so when people cuz  
when I bash on drugs all the time, it's not 
that I'm saying it's not a hell of a party,  
but what I'm saying is it's not sustainable. And 
so what happens is that it's kind of the deal the  
devil gives you something on the front end but 
on the back end it'll [ __ ] you up. So how do  
you explain like later after the party it begins 
to wind down. What happens? Yeah. Yeah. It was  
like uh just like like my brain wouldn't give me 
positive feedback for doing things that I should  
be doing. Like you know like if you clean your 
room and you go like oh I feel good that I did  
that. But like imagine like you clean your room 
and it's just like well now the room's clean.  
I still feel like [ __ ] Right? There's like 
there's nothing in my brain that can produce a  
good feeling anymore because my brain used all of 
those chemicals to reinforce like, hey, you should  
be doing drugs and sleeping with prostitutes, 
right? So, it's like giving me very bad advice,  
right? Very good advice. Yeah. Uh yeah. Drink 
and do drink and do drugs. People will think  
you're cool. Yeah. Yeah. And I mean, you know, you 
know, you know my take on that, bro. So, I mean,  
I think it's [ __ ] terrible. I grew up around 
this [ __ ] People don't understand like I grew  
up around this [ __ ] Okay. I don't think people 
get that. Like I have a past. When I say kids,  
drugs are bad. Okay. I have a past. I have friends 
that I grew up with. I know where that path goes.  
The big one for me too is psychedelics is that's 
huge in the personal growth community. Listen,  
I could do another speech tomorrow about the 
good things that a psychedelic would give you,  
but how you can achieve that without messing 
around with that. And the thing that I don't talk  
about a lot is I've lost probably over 20 awesome 
friends due to psychedelic use because they became  
so [ __ ] whacked out and weird cuz they took it 
too far. And I'm look, I'm not saying some dude  
went and did mushrooms or even the harder like 
psychedelics like more hardcore psychedelics is  
going to [ __ ] you up permanently if you did 
it one time or something. I'm not saying that  
at all. Even people that have done it a bunch of 
times could be fine. I'm just making the point  
that if you take that too far, man, like I have so 
many friends. I've got friends that I could call  
on the phone right now that are like long-term 
friends and I call them on the phone and you  
can't even have a conversation anymore. They're 
just so weird and and look that's coming from me.  
I'm a hell of a weird guy, too. But weird. 
Not like in a fun, entertainer, quirky way,  
but in a way that's very very dark. Like you could 
act like they don't fit like if they're in a room  
like this, there's so much darkness in them they 
can't even let it land anymore. It's like they're  
being given this profound insight and these really 
elevated experiences, but on the back end of it,  
there's all these issues with it. So that's why I 
say like I can show you how to be creative. I can  
show you how to shut down the default mode network 
of your brain and to think laterally and to think  
creatively and to find other solutions. There's 
there's other ways to do it that you can train  
yourself on. And the thing is, you have to learn 
how to train yourself on that stuff. So again,  
I didn't want to take that path because look, I've 
got a lot of friends that are super rich and they  
start going to Burning Man and they start take 
some of these guys are rich beyond rich. I mean,  
you guys know Tony Shay, right? You saw what 
happened to him. Tony Shay, do you guys know  
zapos.com? That's the Amazon for shoes. And Tony 
Shay owned that and he sold it for I think it was  
$850 million to Amazon. And um he's dead now. And 
he used to be at every single Vegas World Summit.  
I never talk about clients names or anything, but 
you know, he's he's gone now. And yeah, I mean,  
I love the guy. Everybody loved Tony. Every 
the president loved Tony. Everybody loved Tony,  
but you saw he got a little bit bored and he um 
he he kind of just retired or semi-retired. And he  
built this whole entire community in Vegas. It's 
super badass. It's super cool. But you just saw  
him getting surrounded by the wrong people again 
and again and again. And that guy's gone. I think  
it was in his 40s. So you know and you saw him 
getting more disconnected and kind of weirder and  
so on and so forth. So you know my personal view 
is you got like my view is that it's a constant  
battle to have accurate reality testing. In fact, 
why don't we repeat that as a mantra in the sloppy  
way. Repeat this after me. I'll take it in chunks. 
It's a constant battle It's a constant battle for  
your reality testing for your reality testing to 
function properly. to function properly. Okay.  
Hey, we got it. We got it. Yeah. Thank you. [ __ ] 
Tony Robbins. I'm I got the incantations now. My  
awkward long one. So yeah, Tony Tony and guys like 
John Maxwell and guys like that are just they're  
really good at the incantations. But anyway, what 
I'm getting at is um um you can your your mind has  
to be constantly looking to falsify data. Kind of 
looping back in with what we've been talking about  
today, right? Your mind has to be constantly 
looking to falsify data and to see where your  
paradigm is limited and to see to see where your 
paradigm has you in a small box and to realize  
there might be an entirely different paradigm that 
they're not aware of. So, you know, for example,  
if you talk to somebody in modern medicine, um you 
know, maybe you go to a liver expert and you say,  
"Hey, tell me about the liver." And they'll tell 
you about all these different things in modern  
medicine they can do. But if you ask them, "What 
are the top foods that could help your liver?"  
You know, there's a bunch. They're never going 
to say artichokes or turmeric or things like  
that. They're just not going to say that stuff. 
They don't know what it is. They're stuck within  
a limited paradigm. Um, again, I'm not giving 
medical advice here. I'm just sharing experience.  
But something as simple as this, my son Dylan, 
when he was being born, um, I was curious to  
learn a bit more about the birthing process. So, I 
looked up this documentary, I think it was Netflix  
or something called, uh, the business of being 
born. And another one's called Born in the USA.  
And it was probably propaganda for midwives. So, 
I understand that everything has a bias. I get  
it that everything is a bias. There's probably a 
lot of disadvantages to midwives and advantages to  
midwives. Probably a bit of both. So, I understand 
when I'm looking at propaganda for either side,  
but nonetheless, there's going to be good 
information within that propaganda. And one  
of the things they said is that by the woman lying 
on her bed in the hospital trying to give birth,  
it's just not a good position for women when 
they should get up and twist around. So,  
and they said what happens that is that then the 
woman uh can't get the kid out and then and then  
the doctor wants to get the damn job done so they 
can go so they can go home to go get dinner with  
their wife so their wife doesn't [ __ ] them out 
or or vice versa her husband doesn't [ __ ] out  
whatever haha PC right and then um a lot of women 
doctors I'll give it but what I'm getting at is  
um uh I watched that so they said that the f the 
way they initiated was something called ptocin  
and that that kind of starts the process to where 
maybe it will help the baby come out but maybe it  
initiates a a C-section. So, I remember they were 
about to give them all my kids ptocin and I said,  
"Hey, would you mind if just for a sec? You 
can get up and move around." And look guys,  
I'm not giving medical advice. You figure this 
out. I'm just sharing an experience. It's just  
an anecdote from a documentary. Okay? So, I'm not 
claiming I know more than a doctor cuz I watch a  
Netflix documentary. But it was just interesting. 
I said, "Hey guys, would you mind if she got up  
and walked around?" They're like, "No, no, she 
can't. She can't." I said, "It's kind of a little  
weird. Like, she's able to get up and move around. 
Like, why can't she get up and just twist around a  
little bit? Like, are you serious?" They're like, 
"No, no, she can't. She can't." I said, "Look,  
I'll back off this. You guys are the doctors. I'm 
not a doctor, but you got to at least give me a  
reason why. And if you can't give me a reason why 
I'm getting her up, I'm sorry. And then finally,  
one of them said, "Well, for insurance purposes, 
we need to keep all these monitors on her. So,  
you know, in order to be solid for insurance, we 
can't let her stand up and get off the monitors."  
I said, "All right, well, guys, like, come 
on." Like, and then another doctor came in  
who actually was like a total badass. I love this 
guy. He goes, "She can get up. Relax." She got up,  
man. Dylan came out of her like 2 seconds after 
that. It was real quick. None of this C-section,  
nothing. I mean, and again, I'm not a doctor. 
I don't know if that applies to most cases.  
I don't know. I don't have an answer. But it was 
just okay, maybe that's just a fluke anecdote.  
I don't really know, guys. But it was just 
interesting to think that their paradigm is  
like have to protect for insurance, have to keep 
the monitors on, administer the potatoes, right?  
They're not thinking beyond that box that they're 
in. There's a uh a book called um the uh in the  
bed with Procrees. And the whole idea of that book 
is that uh the mythical character processes had  
this hotel and you had to fit in and everything's 
perfectly aligned. So if they try to put someone  
in the bed, if they don't fit in the bed properly, 
they either chop off their feet or they chop their  
head off. That is a lot of modern society. Modern 
society is built in a way where everything's meant  
to kind of fit in this perfect box. It's meant 
to function. And you don't realize that you're  
going to get your [ __ ] head chopped off because 
you're trying to be put into this perfect machine  
where you may not fit. So you've got to be aware 
of that and actively seek out solutions. And while  
I think it is good to be bitter to an extent that 
the system is falling apart, you've also got to  
be honest that you're complicit in that falling 
apart. Like you've allowed it to fall apart. It's  
not like you did like I I know you made a post on 
Twitter or something. Okay, cool. But you know,  
or X, but you you didn't really do anything to 
change it. So, if you didn't do something to  
actively change it, and by the way, just getting 
in front of some movement that you haven't looked  
into the background of it does not mean that 
you're inspiring change either, right? Because,  
by the way, they'll tell you like, "Oh, you should 
support this cause or support that cause." Like,  
I support that cause. You don't realize you're 
being [ __ ] played. So, be careful what even  
what you even support cuz you could be getting 
[ __ ] played, guys. Okay? Played in ways you  
would understand. Look up Mike Benz if you want 
to understand how bad people get played. It is  
crazy. Look up Mike Benz. You might want to write 
that down, okay? see how bad people get played.  
He was even on Joe Rogan twice um recently in the 
same month. So, that guy's killing the game. And  
uh he'll show you how you get played. So, you want 
to be but but you have to understand that to some  
degree you're complicit in what's happened. And 
then from there, stop being mad about it. Ask  
yourself what social impact that you can make and 
make sure that you study your topic of interest  
and look to falsify the data and see if you're 
even right about your opinion. because I think a  
lot of people that want to make change, they don't 
do that. Um, but then what I would say is realize  
that you're in this system and that you're going 
to have to adapt to the system that you're in and  
you're going to have to be very, very aggressive 
and very, very creative about it. But at the same  
time, it's not like you don't have support. 
There's incredible content online that you can  
look up. There's incredible communities that you 
can join. There's a lot of different people that  
uh don't like the [ __ ] and that take it 
seriously and that um will give solutions.  
And like I said, I think that what you're going to 
see is when you act when you actively take action,  
you'll probably wind up living a 50 times better 
life now than you would have if the system was  
functioning properly. You actually will. And 
you'll see that your mind is very intelligent.  
You're very capable of waking up. You have a lot 
of agency. You you're you're a child of God. You  
have incredible potential. I don't care man, 
woman, gay, straight, trans, whatever color you  
are, whatever background you have, you are a child 
of God and you have incredible potential no matter  
who you are. And everybody is a child of God. And 
so God has given us different gifts and different  
capacities and the capacity both to share our 
gift, but also to meet with other people that have  
gifts and to learn from their gifts. And that's 
kind of the joy of life. That's the fun of life.  
So even though maybe we had this kind of no war 
relatively tranquil period maybe from after World  
War II with some interruptions between now and 
then that system has gotten a little bit stale. We  
know that and so we say okay did people adapt back 
in the day to a lot more crazier chaos than this?  
Hell yeah they did. Okay. Now, at the same time, 
a lot of the chaos being put on us now, you know,  
has the power of uh computers and the internet 
and soon to be AI and robotics, right? So,  
the you're going to see a what you're going to see 
is a separation of the wheat from the chaff. And  
the Bible, which is my favorite book, um there's 
a lot in the Bible that I take literally. Um but  
there's also some parts of the Bible, and this 
could offend people. I'm sorry about that, that  
I don't take literally. Okay? So, there's some 
parts I take literally and some parts that I don't  
take literally, but I take but some of my favorite 
parts are the parts that I don't take literally.  
I think they're even more important. And some 
of those would be um and I'm not sure again I  
wasn't there, so I can't make a opinion on it, but 
I'm not going to default to taking it literally,  
but rather I I take it as a very very powerful 
story, which is the story of Exodus in the Bible.  
Look, maybe all that happened. I don't know. I 
wasn't there. I'm not trying to offend anybody,  
but I I didn't, you know, there was no uh Snapchat 
or Instagram stories back then. So, you know,  
I wasn't able to see I wasn't able to see the 
parting of the Red Seas, right? I didn't see  
it. But there's some powerful stories in there, 
right? And I think one of the powerful stories  
uh both with Exodus and also with Noah's arc, by 
the way, uh two very very powerful stories. What  
do we learn from the story of Noah's arc. I mean, 
that's a powerful powerful story. Um I mean, look,  
may maybe some guy with a boat did put like 
two lizards and two iguan like two giraffes  
and everything on a boat. I don't know. Maybe it 
happened. I wasn't there. There's no there was no  
uh iPhones back then to record it. But why is that 
maybe one of the most important stories you could  
read? Noah's arc. What what is what is Noah's 
arc trying to communicate to us that story. One  
man can do all that with ironclad faith. One man 
can do that with ironclad faith. I think that's  
a beautiful point you made. It's actually not even 
the one I would have made. I love that point. What  
else? Long-term thinking, not just short-term 
thinking. Long-term thinking. Okay. Um what  
happened to all the people who didn't sense the 
coming flood? They died. They died. So they got  
swept up in the flood. Um in our generation or 
maybe our kids' generation, maybe there will be  
that metaphorical flood between AI and all these 
different things that are happening. We don't  
really know, right? Um so you can prepare. You 
can build the arc or you can not build the arc.  
That's kind of up to you. I mean, how confident do 
you feel in the direction of things? I think that  
there's a lot to be optimistic about actually, 
but I think there's also a lot to be concerned  
about. I think there's I have a mix of incredible 
optimism and concern. But I think that we could  
enjoy the cool opportunities and also be aware of 
liability at the same time. We can walk and chew  
bubble gum at the same time. Um, but I think 
that story of Noah's arc about being prepared  
is powerful. I would say another great another 
great uh component with in Exodus is this idea  
of le of of God's chosen people leaving the sick 
system and the oppressive system and having to go  
uh, you know, on a long journey to build a new 
society. And I think what you're going to see  
is that the lines in the future and the tension 
in the future is not going to be drawn by race or  
religion or uh gender or sexual orientation. 
No one's going to care about that. I mean,  
most people I think don't even care now if I'm 
being honest with you. But maybe a couple last  
weird hillbillies care or something. I don't know. 
But you're going to see people really not care  
in the future. You know what people are going to 
care about in the future? Whether or not you are  
a group thinker and basically being brainwashed at 
a legendary level or whether you're able to think  
for your damn self, I think that will be the big 
separator in the future. It's going to be people  
that are just in a group think trance and it's 
going to be people who are able to wake up. And  
obviously wake up is a broad term. Everyone has 
their own definition of that and they'll have  
infighting even amongst themselves. But you see 
the general idea, the general direction of it.  
And so what you're probably going to see is a 
breakaway societies that just look at the way  
the system is going and they're able to see the 
trajectory and the momentum of that system and  
they're going to have to break off from it. And 
it was very important for me even as a father by  
the way to leave a lot of content behind for my 
kids because I'll probably be dead before I have  
to deal with this. I may or may not be but my kids 
may potentially have to deal with this. They may  
or may not. And so as a result of that, I made a 
lot of video content and and was able to put a lot  
of ideas into my kids' minds and take them around 
to prepare them for what they may have to deal  
with or for what their kids may have to deal with. 
Cuz as a parent, you also have to be thinking  
multigenerationally. You can't just be thinking 
in terms of the moment. You got to be thinking  
50 years in advance, 100 years in advance, a 
couple hundred years in advance, and think about  
your kids and your grandkids and all the things 
that they're going to deal with. So, you know,  
you you can't guarantee success all the time, but 
you just do what you can. if that makes sense too,  
right? But that's the whole idea of leaving that 
system because our children and maybe even us  
will have major major decisions to make of do 
you plug a chip in your brain? Um how much do  
you let AI run your life? Um you know, do we give 
up the government to AI? Um there's going to be a  
lot of weird questions that are going to come up 
in the future, right? And the thing that I think  
a lot of people don't realize, like, you know, 
maybe you talk about people that want a lower  
population and then you say, "Well, yeah, I don't 
think that we should have as high of a population.  
Maybe it should be lower." Okay, but who's the 
decider on that? Look at these [ __ ] that try  
to be the decider on that. Is they should be the 
decider? What? Cuz they own a tech business. Okay,  
I know this is Seattle, but guys, come on. I've 
met some of these people. Do you guys know that  
I It is so rare that I dislike anybody. I mean, 
it is crazy rare. any clients like could be the  
most difficult client, could be the most annoying 
people, people that even like [ __ ] me over super  
bad and I still have love for them. It's very 
rare, so rare like maybe 10 people in my life  
that I honestly look at them and I'm like, I 
don't like anything about this person. Like  
none of it. I can't find anything. It was almost 
all tech billionaires that I coached. Wow. Yeah.  
Wow. Yeah. That just honestly like so sick. So 
deeply satanic and sick. And so I've seen the  
other side of this. Some of them are great, by the 
way. Some of them are awesome ones that I've prop
and I'll do the best I can for them and I make 
money but it's really sick and I think it's  
because like uh says in the Bible right harder 
for a for a rich man or for a camel to go through  
the eye of a needle than a rich man to go in the 
kingdom of heaven paraphrase right and it's just  
that they they have so much given to them that 
they're in some ways cut off from God because they  
don't have friction anymore and it it puts them in 
a weird headsp space and these are the people that  
you trust to run your life. I feel like it also 
relates to how you say that like I mean it's maybe  
a little woo but like the energy of Satan targets 
high leverage people 100% you know so they're in  
the position to make massive changes in society 
so the temptation for them is going to be the most  
powerful of all 100%. Yes 100%. 100%. So yeah, 
so I guess the larger uh message that I'm kind  
of trying to give to you guys is look, you guys 
know that I live in the Hollywood Hills in LA,  
right? You guys know that that I also spend time 
out in Olympic Park in Washington State. Okay,  
so I'm out there hanging out with like regular 
Americans in Bandon Beach, Oregon. Okay,  
I'm headed to Bosezeman, Montana. I like to hang 
out in Jackson, Wyoming. So I'm in a lot of small  
towns. Okay, I like to be in, you know, the part 
of California that's different than just Los  
Angeles. Okay, I'm up I'm up there in Arcada, 
California, you know, places like that. Okay,  
I'm all up in there hanging out with people. 
So, I hang out with regular people. But you  
guys also know that I've coached a lot of high 
level people and you also know that I'm around  
the Hollywood Hills scene, Miami, New York, elite 
social circles, and I've been around that as well.  
I've been at tables with world famous politicians 
and all sorts of stuff. And as a result of that,  
I've kind of seen a wide breath. And by the way, 
I don't just um pedestalize regular people either.  
They have their problems and often don't take 
enough agency. So there's a mix of different  
things. Um but I've sort of seen a lot of what's 
going on. And what I would tell you is this guys,  
give me two seconds. What I Okay, what I would 
tell you is this. Um you've got to take agency.  
Okay. Like you're not in an environment that 
you can't study personal growth. You're just  
not. Okay? You can't. You just can't. Um, you 
know, there's there's even questions that were  
that arose surrounding the vote in 2020, right? 
And I don't have concrete information on that,  
and I'm not giving you my opinion, but even basic 
institutions like that, you know, to be honest,  
like I think Trump may have lost, but I'll 
say this. Do you trust mail-in ballots? No.  
You think a mail in B like you think a mail in 
ballot could be fraud? implemented like that.  
It was just very sketchy the way the whole thing 
played out and how conveniently it lined up with  
the whole operation. Yeah. I mean, look, I don't 
know. I I don't I don't I'm not making a claim  
about the election. Yeah. But if you just ask 
me a straight question about mail, I Right. So,  
what I'm getting at is you've got to you've 
got to stop just trusting the system blindly.  
You can get benefit from the system, but don't 
just trust it blindly. and become somebody who  
is a self-initiator and a seeker of knowledge and 
an executor. Okay? And again, men, we need to win  
and win and win. If you were a woman, would you 
trust yourself to be soft and feminine with the  
average man that you see on the street? [ __ ] no. 
Would you trust yourself to be soft and feminine  
with men that allowed the system to get to this 
point? [ __ ] Yeah. Would you trust yourself  
to be soft and feminine with a system with this 
many threats? No. you you know you know that you  
can't right so there's so there's a lot of things 
that are going on there's a lot of conversations  
that are going to have to be had there's a lot of 
conversations that you know people like me we kind  
of begin we tend to be the tip of the spear and 
kind of start conversations we're not necessarily  
the people that have it at like a national level 
we're a little bit more ahead of the curve and  
then that information gets disseminated to a to a 
bigger level so when I make a you know a piece of  
content like this what I'm looking to do is I'm 
just looking to start conversations that's really  
what I'm trying to do with you guys I'm just just 
recording a little piece of content here. Just  
trying to start a little bit of a conversation. 
That's it. Okay. I don't have all the answers. I  
don't claim to. Um I've got a couple major areas 
that I'm really, really, really well verssed. And  
then what I've also done is I've brought in and 
hired out and sought out the best people that I  
possibly can to help me in the areas that I don't 
have time to master, but I've made sure that I go  
after the right people and gotten them around me. 
I have mentors that I either pay money to or that  
I'm very lucky to have in my life. I have peers 
that help me and I have other people that I teach  
and help them to come up as well and then I just 
come at life as best I can. And you know, again,  
like I mentioned, I've taken a lot of like I've 
made a lot of little bit of crazy decisions. So  
that's up to me to deal with that. I understand 
that. But overall, I think for most of you guys,  
they're not down such a crazy path. I think 
that you guys can build exceptional lives.  
And what I'd say is rather than being pissed off, 
realize that there's that while we have problems,  
I think we also have potential. There's a lot 
that's been built. There's a lot of incredible  
technology, a lot of incredible infrastructure. 
There are good people out there. There are great  
teachers out there. There are great solutions 
out there. There's incredible potential. So  
rather than just straight giving up, don't let 
yourself get demoralized. Um it's like a snake,  
right? The system's like a snake where it kind of 
like pulls you in and squeezes you and it's like  
just relax. Just relax. You'll be okay. Right? 
Then you kind of relax a bit or it'll loosen  
up so you relax and then it pulls in and makes it 
tighter. And it does it and then it's almost just  
like go to sleep. go to sleep, right? And you 
just give up. And to me, what giving up means,  
giving up means, as an example, you know, you get 
so pissed off that women are all crazy these days  
that you think you can't find someone to have 
kids with, right? Cuz you're so pissed, you know,  
you just give up. You're like, "Well, it can't 
be done. I can't even meet one." Giving up means,  
"Oh, I can't make money here. Even though there's 
tons of opportunity, I can't make money." Giving  
up means, "Oh, our country is [ __ ] we can't 
fix the [ __ ] country. Giving up means ah,  
you know, we'll just let AI run everything. We'll 
just let the overlord chooses who lives or die,  
whatever, right? That's just giving up. So that's 
demoralization. That we can't have big projects,  
inspirational projects, things that compel us, 
things that are exciting to us. That's giving  
up. But instead, what we can do is we cannot get 
demoralized. And that's like probably the single  
biggest lesson that I want to impart to my kids 
is don't get so used to losing that you don't  
remember how to win anymore. Okay? Like I said, as 
guys, we got to be building win streaks. So don't  
get so used to losing that you don't remember how 
to win anymore. In fact, keep winning and winning  
and winning and winning. Create small goals, knock 
them off. Bigger goals, knock them off. Okay,  
maybe something bad happens. Fine. Get better 
mentors, get better information. Look at your  
execution. Get back up and stay in the fight. Say 
the word stay in the fight. Stay in the fight.  
Yeah, that's a big component. You got to stay in 
the fight, okay? Because that's fundamentally what  
human beings are built for. We're actually built 
for struggle. We're actually wired for that. And  
we actually can thrive off of that. So, you can 
stay in the fight. And you can build your own life  
[ __ ] amazing. You can build a great, very, very 
cool life for yourself. But you can also leave an  
incredible legacy. So, no matter how much, and 
you guys know a lot of [ __ ] got thrown at me,  
but no matter how much shit's got thrown to me, I 
never gave up. I never believed I couldn't do it  
or I never believed I couldn't make a difference. 
I didn't believe I couldn't change my own life.  
I just stayed in the fight. And I've had, if I 
were to give you, I could give you guys a 5h hour  
uh story about setbacks that I've had and all this 
stuff. And you'd all give me a hug and you feel  
bad for me. But at the end of the day, that's just 
like a bunch of [ __ ] tests from your wife, okay?  
It's like that's just the universe just acting 
up a little bit to see if you really want it. So,  
you know, if you really want it, you got to go 
for it. And a shark swims not necessarily to get  
somewhere. Although it wants to get somewhere, 
it swims to stay alive. So human beings,  
we thrive when in a state of motion. That doesn't 
mean not to meditate or relax or take a day off.  
You got to recover or sleep. But we thrive with 
emotion. And what happens that when we have a  
bigger vision and we're engaging, that's when 
we're actually the most happy. So you've always  
you always want to be whether it's working within 
a business or on a business that you're running,  
you want to be building things. You want to have 
aspirations. You want to have things that motivate  
you, goals that excite you. You want to take on 
big projects that are harder than you're normally  
used to doing. You want to push yourself. You want 
to see what's possible. And just keep driving into  
it. And you'll find that when you do that, when 
combined with really good active recovery, really  
good sleep, time in nature, meditation, time for 
contemplation that you balance that with, that's  
when you're going to be the most happy. That's 
what we're really built to do. And human beings.  
We're not just built to be stuck here on Earth 
and nuke each other, have AI take over, just get  
[ __ ] like that. We're built to go interstellar. 
We're built We're built for more. We're built out  
spiritual awakening, mass awakening. We need a 
human awakening project. We're built to to slide  
into our purpose to awaken higher capacities in 
our mind that are absolutely incredible. And we  
can start with basic things. Smash it at dating. 
Smash it with money. Smash it with travel. Smash  
it with having fun with your friends. Smash it 
with spiritual connection. As you're doing that,  
you're building a foundation where you can then 
build even bigger projects. And I think the way  
that it's meant to go is, you know, maybe in your 
20s, you get really good at dating and you start  
to build out some skills. In your 30s, then you go 
on to uh, you know, begin to build your empire and  
then you begin to get really good at your job, 
make more cash. Then in your 40s when you have  
that stuff down, maybe you take five or six years, 
maybe go into nature in your mid-40s or something.  
Get really spiritually tapped in. Think a lot 
about what it is you want to do with your life.  
That's what I did. Get really clear on it. And 
then maybe between 45 and 65. That's really when  
you leave your big impact. But here's the truth. 
Some of you watching this are older and you didn't  
make that timeline. That's fine. The best time to 
start would have been decades ago. The second best  
time is now. Like I said, never get demoralized. 
It doesn't matter what happens. When I when I  
broke my leg, they told me I might not walk 
again. I never got demoralized a single time.  
I'm not trying to sound tough, but I understood 
the importance of not getting demoralized. So,  
if anything, I was extra enthusiastic. I was 
thinking, well, what advantages do I have out  
of this? Like, what what will this help me to 
do rather than being pissed off about it? Now,  
I happen to be able to walk again, but I didn't 
know. So, you want to be thinking to yourself,  
don't get demoralized. Keep always have belief, 
always be 100% confident, always have 100%  
certainty that you can get the right mentors, find 
the flaws in your thinking, find the flaws in your  
paradigm, find the right tools that you need, 
build that out, have fun with it, and stay in the  
fight. And then other people after you're dead 
and gone, your work will live on through them,  
and they can build on what you've done as well. 
And that is really what I would pound into my sons  
just over and over and over. was like, "Don't let 
him steal your soul. Don't let him demoralize you.  
Don't let the situation demoralize you. You have 
agency." And by the way, you guys are mostly in  
here American. Look, I'm saying this to Canadian 
as like an external consultant. That's the  
American way. That is what makes America great. 
That is your culture, by the way. That's your  
culture. That is who you are. That is literally 
who you are, okay? As American. That's true. That  
is literally who you are. So, I'm saying that as 
like an outside consultant. That is literally who  
you are. Okay. So to my sons that are American, 
I say to them, you are American. This is this you  
believe in freedom. You believe in self-reliance. 
You believe in not needing the big daddy overlord  
to run your [ __ ] life. You can find your own 
solutions. You now are part of that heritage  
of people that basically did a lot of the most 
inspiring [ __ ] in the [ __ ] world. And the  
thing is is that I think that that America to me 
what America represents, okay, and I'm saying this  
as a non-American, what America represents to me 
is that concept and I really think that America  
is is something that should be worldwide, that 
kind of thinking. I don't think that that should  
be limited just to one country. I when I look 
at Hong Kong and their protests against what  
was happening, many of them are more American 
than people that live in a [ __ ] America.  
Okay, they're wear waving American flags. I think 
that that spirit lives on in anybody who actually  
wants to stay in the fight. That's what it really 
is, right? When Trump, you can hate the guy. I  
don't care. But when he got shot at, what he 
what's literally what's the three words out  
of his mouth? Fight, fight, fight. That's what he 
said, right? And and look, that guy's [ __ ] you  
can hate the guy, love the guy. That guy's [ __ ] 
loaded. Did you guys see how much [ __ ] came at  
him? Do you guys see that? Do you guys know that 
guy? You can hate the guy, hate his policies,  
hate anything. but pass whatever policies that'll 
get eventually flipped over and overturned and  
will cause some problems and out of their benefits 
and so on and so forth. There's something deeper  
in that guy that will remain in 100 years from now 
or 200 years from now. What do you guys think that  
is? You could think his policies suck. You think a 
lot about him sucks? Conviction. Well, it's a it's  
a guy that that's literally a billionaire 
that's out there getting shot at, getting  
getting put in jail, getting mugshotted, getting 
attacked, getting lied about. Again, you can  
hate his policies. You can even think the guy's a 
[ __ ] I'm just talking about the bigger picture,  
what will remain because in the future maybe the 
leftwing or the Democrat party would be a better  
party than the Republican party and maybe they'll 
look up to a guy like Trump because the it kind of  
flips back and forth, right? So parties changed 
and so on and so forth. But what they'll learn  
from him, he will go down as a living legend. That 
guy will go down as a legend specifically because  
of what he fought through and the fact that he 
didn't give up and that he actually pulled that  
[ __ ] out of a hat. He had a lot of help. He had 
a lot of help behind the scenes, a lot of help he  
doesn't even know about. And he had a lot of 
help from God. But you knew when that [ __ ]  
bullet whizzed by his ear, you knew that that was 
God helping him. You knew that for a fact. Even if  
you hate the guy, you knew that for a fact. 
Even if you hate the guy, okay? even if you  
hate the guy that there's something that even in 
someone who you hate, somebody who's despicable,  
somebody who even has some bad qualities, there's 
something fundamentally American about staying in  
the fight and about winning and about remembering 
how to win and about not getting demoralized  
and not letting people just put you to [ __ ] 
sleep and just straight giving up on your life,  
but actually believing that your life can be 
awesome, that there is a better future. He  
calls it the second golden age. Is this really 
going to be a second golden age? [ __ ] know  
that's right. I'll give you a second golden age. 
But but at the same time, what's important about  
just saying it's a second golden age? What do you 
guys think? Hope. Stay pumped. Hope. Stay pumped.  
Believing that it's believing it's a second golden 
age. Look, here's the truth. It is a second golden  
age if we believe it's a second golden age. Does 
that make sense? Like we choose that. We choose  
what to believe or what to focus on subjectively 
to make that a second golden age. You can hear  
what Trump is saying. Look, he's trying to be a 
cheerleader. The guy's the guy's How old is this  
[ __ ] at this point? I mean, how old is this man? 
What's that? I think he's older than that. I'm not  
sure. How old is this man? Is he pushing 80 at 
this point? I mean, this he's getting up there,  
bro. I mean, what do you want from the man? 
You know, this guy's older than your grandpa,  
bro. And, you know, and he's eating like 
McDonald's and diet cokes and [ __ ] So,  
this this diet coke, McDonald's fueled man who's 
79 years old, he's just he's just trying his best,  
bro. He's like second golden age. I mean, you 
can question it and be a [ __ ] or you can just  
run with it, you know? Just run with it. Yes. 
Thank you, grandpa, for putting down your Big  
Mac and letting me know it is the second golden 
age. Okay? So, you've got to believe it's the  
second golden age. Okay? Believe it. Believe 
it. Believe. Believe. Believe. Believe it.
It's the second golden age. Okay? I tell you 
like, believe it. And if you and when you  
choose to adopt that posture, one thing that he 
understands is he understands battle formation.  
Like he understands attack mode. He knows that 
when he gets clowned in a debate, just to tell him  
to get [ __ ] and not to Well, to be fair, some of 
his debates a little questionable there, but when  
he's at his peak in 2016, that guy understood just 
stay in battle formation. Just stay there. And and  
the fact that he even had to go into base at that 
age just shows how [ __ ] everything is that he  
had to keep going in there when he's older. So 
stay in that mode. What is the correct mode to  
stay in? Absolute confidence, absolute belief. 
Try to find problems, looking for solutions,  
looking outside the box. Look, that dude will 
[ __ ] up. You'll do a lot of dumb [ __ ] too.  
It's not It's going to be pros and cons, but just 
look at the psychology, the the winning type of  
psychology. People come at you, [ __ ] no. Keep 
going. Power through obstacles. Power through. Oh,  
they put him in jail. They they shot at him. 
They they lied about him. They attacked him in  
the media. They attacked him everywhere. They 
Can you imagine the conversation with him and  
Zuckerberg? Like, oh, I did not mean to delete you 
from Facebook. He I was kidding, Donald. Can you  
imagine what that was like? Can you imagine how 
satisfying it must have been for him of the guys  
that banned him to him to be like, "Hey, how's 
it going?" It must have been satisfying, right?  
Incredible satisfaction. You saw his son Baron 
who could be a star someday. You saw him literally  
like walk up to Biden just whisper some [ __ ] 
in his ear and like I wonder what he was saying,  
right? But he watched the [ __ ] they tried to do 
to his dad. But that's the point is again love or  
hate the guy or his policies. Taking that taking 
that American type of mentality, second golden  
age mentality. Is this the golden age? Yes. Do you 
believe? Yes. Will you solve the problem? Yes. Do  
you feel certainty? Yes. Can you find the solution 
and win? Yes. Can you win and win and win?  
Yes. Yes. Yes. That's the kind of mindset and then 
stay in that mindset permanently or maybe take a  
break and take a breather to chill for a minute, 
you know? But in general, that's got to be the  
kind of mindset that you have. And you know, it's 
funny. I haven't really disclosed it, but I have  
kind of had my own little personal version of 
some of the BS that that guy has been through.  
I don't really talk about it cuz frankly, I don't 
have a multi-billion dollar war chest. And so, the  
more you talk about, the more that you encourage 
it. But I've had my little smaller moments that  
that were meaningful to me. And you know, I fought 
through with a broken leg and I fought through it  
with betrayal. Lot of lot of Judas [ __ ] betrayal 
type situations and all that, but I never gave up  
on the vision that I had. And the vision that I 
had was to leave a legacy of great content and  
great teaching and helping people and finding 
solutions and and leaving the content necessary  
for my own kids. So these are solutions that I 
wanted to come up with and I'm going to stay in  
the fight and I hope that you guys stay in the 
fight. So that to me is the fundamental American  
way. And you want to get around people that fuel 
that, that challenge you and will contradict your  
beliefs, but overall believe in the success of 
the totality of the mission, okay? That you can  
build a life you want. You can have you can have 
a lot of fun, you can make a lot of money, you can  
have a great dating life, a great partner to have 
kids with, you can actually build a cool company  
or or work within a company that's cool. Do the 
vacations that you want. You can start building  
things. You can raise the vibe spiritually, the 
people that are around you. You can uplift the  
people that are around you. You can be a source 
of light to other people. You can actually learn  
and grow from mistakes and do better. You can 
actually leave a legacy, whether that's children,  
whether that's not children, but it's just the 
legacy of knowledge and good vibes that you leave.  
But whatever the case, you can do that, too. And 
if you just keep believing that and then you focus  
on just laughing and having fun during the process 
or maybe taking some punches to the face but just  
getting the [ __ ] back up and staying in the 
fight, honestly, you could do whatever you want  
with your life. But again, you'll look at the 
TikTok and the short form content and the brain  
rot and all that and it's pulling you in. And 
instead, what you got to do is get around the  
right people, get the right mentors, get the right 
peer group, get the right mastermind, go and help  
other people take leadership positions. Clearly 
define what it is that you want to do. Continue  
to scope down what those goals are, what you're 
trying to get out of life, what lights you up,  
what you find fun. And here's what you'll find. 
It's as simple as this. You remember I said it was  
the reason why I did the things that I did. What' 
I say? Was it that I had to do it? Do I have to do  
it? No. I did it because I found the other [ __ ] 
[ __ ] boring. It's just under stimulating and  
[ __ ] boring. And when you don't engage with the 
kind of direction, I'm not saying specifically,  
but the general direction that we're talking about 
here, what happens that by the time you hit 40,  
you get brain wrot. Okay? And the age at which 
you should have been your most intelligent,  
your 40s, your 50s, your 60s, and beyond, getting 
sharper, happier, more present, more tapped in,  
brain working better. What do you see in a lot of 
people that are in their 40s? Oh, dead. They're  
slowing down and they're like an emptied out 
husk. They've given up. The snake has envelated
and that's it. And it's in the group think and it 
doesn't want to be disturbed and it's in a super  
cope. Okay. It's just in a Jurassic super cope. I 
just don't want to be annoyed and bothered. Just  
give me my drink and my TV or whatever. It's a 
[ __ ] It's like they get calcified. And a super  
cope. As you get older, you should be looser, 
laughing more, smiling more. Even though you've  
been [ __ ] over, maybe gone broke, had injuries 
happen, had people die, bad stuff happen. If  
anything, that should make you appreciate life 
more. That doesn't mean that the second that it  
happens that you're not crying or upset. But once 
you get your [ __ ] together, you can appreciate  
your life a lot more. And then continue down the 
path and choose to stay in the fight. And like  
I said, the fundamental American mindset for you 
guys that are American, this is who you are. Okay?  
You don't like it, go to China. Okay? This is 
who you are. This is your identity. This is your  
identity. This is what it means to be American. 
Okay? this general direction, freedom, looking  
out for yourself, look and not needing some 
overlord and sucking their dick, okay? Thinking  
for yourself and building the life of your dreams. 
That open road. You're just out there freedom. The  
open road like an open world video game instead 
of being stuck in some weird [ __ ] right? Imagine  
you went bowling and at first you're having fun 
bowling. You know, you throw the ball down and  
occasionally it goes off to the side. What makes 
it feel good when you hit the pins that you're  
that you're actually bowling? What if what if the 
bowling gets thinner and thinner the lane thinner  
and thinner until it's just this predetermined 
little thing that it goes down and you just roll  
the ball and it's predetermined? Yeah, you hit 
more you hit more balls, but is it satisfying? No,  
it's actually the losses that make it satisfying. 
It's who you had to become in the process that  
provides the satisfaction, the flavor, the 
texture. You have to have a pallet for it.  
And here's the bigger issue, too. Yeah, maybe you 
you don't wouldn't miss shots like that, but who  
decides the direction of the bowling ball? You see 
that? Because that's the ultimate loser mentality,  
right? You might like the idea that you never miss 
a shot, but do you trust somebody else to decide  
how that lane gets built? Some random person that 
you never met, and they're going to decide how  
that bowling game even works. So, you don't even 
get to play bowling anymore. Maybe maybe maybe the  
guy that builds the new game is actually really 
good at it, but maybe like a lot of government  
employees, he sucks. And so even though a lot of 
great government employees too. So you see where  
I'm getting at here, right? So you so you want 
to be in the fight. You want that open game. But  
what's going to happen is culturally what you're 
seeing is again good times make weak people or  
weak people make good or strong people make good 
times, good times make weak people, weak people  
make bad times. you're seeing it move into that 
into that zone. And what's going to happen is that  
when the dust settles on that, okay, like after 
the lockdowns, when the dust settles on that,  
you're going to see a lot of people awake. And we 
are actually in something called the culture war.  
This is a real thing, a culture war where they 
destroy people's lives if they have a different  
vision of what culture looks like. Mob people 
like a pack of hornets and destroy them, get  
them fired, and ruin them. It's a culture war. And 
that's because the internet is has thrown culture  
into into chaos, right? But when the dust settles 
on this, America is going to have to rediscover  
itself. And that's why I talk about this. This 
is who you are. Okay? You have the capacity to  
stay in the fight and to determine your own 
outcomes. You really, really, really do. You  
have so much energy. You don't even realize how 
much energy you have, by the way. You have crazy  
vast amounts of energy. I mean, you really do. 
You have it just if you don't feel it, it's cuz  
you're not tapped into the right projects. You're 
not around the right people. You're not inspired,  
right? So, you walk around low energy trying to 
caffeinate yourself and so on and so forth. A  
little caffeine is not going to kill you, but you 
know my point, right? So, you've got crazy crazy  
amounts of energy. Um, I can promise you that as 
I'm looking at you guys, there's potentials in you  
that you don't even know what you have access to. 
Insane potential. You guys have crazy potentials  
that are not even awakened yet. And then we're 
ready to give away our humanity to AI before we  
even understand what our humanity is. You think 
that you weren't given the tools that you need?  
you were. Okay, so your potential is insane. 
And that's what I want to just leave you with,  
okay? Your potential is insane. And this is 
what I would tell you, okay? And human beings,  
we can be everything from a sloppy [ __ ] derper 
to someone of great potential. And we can sit  
there just saying, "Oh, I'm a [ __ ] retard." 
Or you can say, "I am a child of God. I do have  
potential. There is something more in me." And we 
can rather than demoralizing each other and saying  
humans are a virus or whatever the [ __ ] we 
say, we can say humans are beautiful and we have  
incredible potential. Like we really really really 
do. Okay? And that's something we need a human  
awakening project and we need that to begin to 
shift. Back in the day, church could have served  
that function. But church, in my view, there's 
some incredible churches, but I think a lot of  
modern churches have got so used to losing that 
it's almost like, you know, they just run out on  
the street like you're going to go to hell if you 
don't read this, you know, stuff like that. It's  
almost like they're trying to lose at that point. 
There's no legitimate attempt at real outreach.  
And so that is what I would also say to you is 
like don't there's going to have to be something  
new that helps with that. Okay? Look at just being 
here in this room, being here for a couple hours,  
just one guide chatting. But really what needs 
to happen is it shouldn't just be me chatting. It  
should be all of us chatting, right? I'm not just 
up here knocking out vids and speeches, but it  
should be all of us chatting and everybody should 
be involved. And if you imagine if you had that,  
I don't know, say it was every Sunday or whatever, 
right? Imagine that you had that and the community  
had that and that the people that were involved 
in it were getting better. People were actually  
improving, taking on leadership positions, and 
they were stepping up and they were stepping  
up for the people that they're role models for. 
Imagine how society would change. And if we don't  
create something like that in the future and it's 
only just done off the internet and people are  
just living through their phones, it's not done in 
real life. First of all, they can just delete it  
off the freaking phone. So, it has to be in real 
life. It just has to be for that exact reason. Um,  
but beyond that, what you're also going to see is 
that people are getting demoralized. And we don't,  
it doesn't have to be that way. Does that make 
sense what I'm telling you guys? It doesn't have  
to be that way. So, what I'm trying to show you 
is how I personally approached a lot of my own  
demoralization because I was very demoralized 
growing up. How I approached challenges that  
entered into my own life and stayed in the 
fight and didn't give up when I wanted to  
many times. Um, how I approached looking at the 
social landscape and how [ __ ] up it is and  
deciding what the hell it is that I'm going to do 
about it. And then also how I approached the mass  
demoralization that I saw and making a decision 
that rather than participating that I wasn't going  
to get sucked in. Okay. And the outcome of it has 
been that I've had a really fun life and I've had  
enough fun at this age that I could die now a 
happy man. I've knocked off almost every bucket  
list item that I have. And I think it's actually 
very normal for a grown man to have knocked off  
most of his bucket list by his 40s or 50s and to 
get to live a bit selfishly to have some fun. And  
then as you get older, that will naturally start 
to, you know, your selfish things that you want  
while they're still enjoyable will mute a little 
bit because you've just done them so many times.  
And so what starts to happen is that you've done 
those things so many times. been so oversatiated  
and get every everything that you want that what 
starts to happen is that legacy becomes more  
important to you. That's where you might care more 
about kids or legacy or the energy that you leave  
behind. And I think that your older age or middle 
age and older age should be focused on making the  
world better. Not because you're a little goody 
goody trying to virtue signal like I'm trying to  
make the world better, but because it's actually 
more fun. And what happens is that if you make if  
you just get stuck in just personal gratification 
in older age, eventually the pleasures of it just  
the juice just isn't worth the squeeze anymore. 
Like whatever you're getting out of it, like kind  
of like what you were saying about dopamine and 
having being able to feel pleasure, you'll feel  
like how you felt after drugs, but you'll be 45. 
You'll have literally dated every kind of girl  
that you want, been to all the best parties, been 
to all the best restaurants, been to everything,  
satiated yourself because you worked hard, and 
you'll wake up at 45 and nothing does it anymore.  
There's just nothing to keep you going anymore. 
That's kind of what I realized. So, I don't know  
exactly what to do next. What you do about it 
is find something you believe in. Um, something  
that motivates you, something that lights you up, 
something that something that you're passionate  
enough about that you die for it. Something that 
you're passionate enough about that you die for  
that thing. And that's a level of motivation I 
think a lot of people don't understand. And it  
takes personal reflection. It's why I went into 
the forest for five years and didn't keep pushing  
my social media among other reasons too. But 
it's why I spent so much time in nature. I had  
to really do a lot of soul searching and be like, 
well, what do I want to what do I want to use  
uh that time in my older age for? Is it just to 
compete? Is it, you know, if you guys remember  
back in the day how competitive I was in business? 
Any other coaching company similar to mine had no  
oxygen because we were running it. We had such 
an iron grip on it that I just said, "Okay,  
we're just going to win and win and win. We're 
going to dominate. We're going to crush it. Nobody  
else will operate our level. We will just be the 
best. And that was the standard. A lot of people  
couldn't keep up with it. It freaked them out. 
But that's the kind of level that I like to run  
at. That's the gear that I like to run in. And I 
did that. And for so long, I couldn't even handle  
the idea that we were not just dominating and 
being the dominant force. But at a certain point,  
when you've won the game so many freaking times 
over, it's like a video game that you've beaten  
the [ __ ] out of. You've you've you've you've 
won the game over and over and over and over. At a  
certain point, you're like, "What video game am I 
even playing anymore?" Like, "What am I even doing  
or even playing anymore at this point? So, is 
this really is winning just me getting more clout,  
more fame, more money, you know, more sex, more 
restaurants, or is there something past that?" And  
what'll happen is you'll get it's just cuz really 
it's just a video game. Like getting the money,  
getting the girls, all that stuff. It's just a 
video game. Okay? And so, what happens that you'll  
get to a level in that video. Now, a lot of guys 
want to pretend like I'm at that level now. Like,  
come on, man. Show me your bank. Like, show 
me the show me the Instagram last five girls  
you did. Like, bro, you're probably not there. 
But you can get there with a with applied uh  
strategy and execution. And because human beings 
are so intelligent, you will get there. Like, you  
will get there. You will get there because you're 
human, which means you're crazy [ __ ] smart. Um,  
and I grew up, by the way, as a failing student 
initially. Uh, and I grew up dumb as nails,  
but my brain just woke up because I exposed the 
right paradigms, right actions, right focus,  
right beliefs. like what we talked about earlier, 
uh, beliefs, focus, physiology, self-fulfilling  
prophecy, get in a flywheel, your brain will wake 
the [ __ ] up. I mean, you'll wake up real quick.  
You'll start stacking wins real quick. Um, 
so you'll stack wins, stack them, stack them,  
stack them, stack them, stack them, stack them. I 
think that that's what you want to do when you're  
young. You could be selfish. It's fine. Stack a 
lot of wins for yourself. Don't let anyone tell  
you it's just selfish. You got to do it. What do 
you What even good are you to other people if you  
can't stack some wins for yourself? So, go stack 
a lot of wins. From there though, then you got to  
find something deeper that you believe in. Right? 
If just something selfish doesn't work for you,  
then realize that that selfish thing that you 
build, you can build something on top of that.  
And then start asking yourself, where do I want 
to take that? And then that begins to inspire  
you and and and you know, you start building 
collectives of friends around it and people  
that share that same vision and um whole entire 
lifestyle around it and all sorts of things that  
you're doing that wake you up every day excited. 
And then what happens that you're starting to now  
tap into deeper parts of your brain. It's like 
little unlocks that never would have happened  
if you didn't do this. Your brain will unlock as 
much potential as you simulate it to is what I  
would tell you. Okay? It's kind of like busting a 
nut. You know what I'm saying? Right? Like however  
much you jerk on is how much nuts you're going to 
bust. And in the same way, just got to throw that  
in there. And in the same way, um, your brain is 
going to wake up to the extent that you activate  
it. Your spirit's going to awaken to the extent 
that you activate it. Right? In the Bible, in the  
gospels, things like uh the da jing, the power of 
now, we learn how to activate the spirit. We learn  
how to activate and awaken the soul. How much do 
you want to activate it? How much do you how much  
do you build your business and focus on activating 
that? How much do you build up your potential and  
focus on activating it? How much how much freedom 
can you take before like a [ __ ] you cave in and  
ask the overlords to come shove their dick in your 
ass? Okay. How much beauty and potential can you  
take? Really, how much beauty and potential can 
you take? And and I say that because I'll bring my  
friends on nature trips and they can't handle it. 
They can't. It's too much beauty. They run home.  
I've even done it when I was younger, too. I've 
been at tables with all the winners and [ __ ]  
it up and run off. I've made those mistakes. I've 
met the bell of the bowl. Most beautiful girl at  
the club. super into me. I get all weird about it 
and run home and I don't do anything. Right? So,  
the question is, how much winning can you 
actually take? I watched that with a lot of  
people that I coach to be instructors back in the 
day. Usually, right around when they got to about  
a million dollars, they would [ __ ] it up and go 
nuclear and go ballistic and self-sabotage and do  
crazy [ __ ] Years later, their heads all [ __ ] 
spun up. Man, I was a rockstar. I was killing  
it. Why' I [ __ ] everything up and burn all my 
relationships and act all crazy? Someone will make  
up [ __ ] on the [ __ ] internet. People believe 
them. And it's the and I don't say [ __ ] but it's  
the saddest thing to watch you've ever [ __ ] 
seen. It really [ __ ] is. It's just sad. So,  
how much awesomeness and how much beauty can you 
take, you know? If you were some like college  
dropout and two years later you're a millionaire, 
it's a lot to take. So, then you ask the overlords  
to shove their dick in your [ __ ] ass. Why? 
Take their dick out of your ass. Okay. You can  
have one last prostate orgasm as you remove it. 
Take it out. And then what'll happen is you say,  
"I don't want that dick in my ass anymore. I 
want to be the commander of my own ship. And  
I can take the beauty of this. I can take it 
being awesome. I can be inspired." Do you guys  
notice that all that I'm doing here, if you if you 
pause and just look at what it is that I'm doing,  
all that I'm doing is I'm like a freestyle rapper 
and I'm just free associating some [ __ ] that  
could be uplifting or inspirational. You guys 
see what I'm doing here? And what happens if I  
just free associate on things that are higher vibe 
and more potential possibilities oriented around  
demoralization? What's happening to your mood if 
I just spit like this? And how many hours could I  
do this? Forever. Yeah, I could do this forever. 
And for me, when I wind down a talk, just like  
when So the thing is, if I'm doing this with you 
guys, what am I doing in my own mind? What's it  
like to be in my mind? Why don't I need to have 
a PowerPoint for the speech? What's it like to be  
in my mind? You're just letting it arise. Just a 
good place to be. You're feeling it. Yeah. Guys,  
what is it like to be in my brain? It's an upward 
spiral. Thousand out of 10. Like a Yeah. Thousand  
out of 10. Okay. Upward spiral, right? Winning. 
Okay. Charlie Sheen, Tiger Blood. Okay. Um,  
also recognizing problems, recognizing liability, 
taking some time to rest or even to be a little  
depressed for myself here or there if I need it. 
I'm not trying to be Superman. I'm not trying to  
just a little cartoonish on a video, but I'm not 
I'm not a cartoon character. I'm a human. But just  
that's what it's like to be in my brain. So, what 
am I doing when I'm around you guys? What what  
is a speech like this? Not with a PowerPoint, not 
even organized, free associating like a freestyle  
rapper. What kind of speech am I giving you guys? 
Like, what am I doing here? What am I giving you  
access to? It's an energetic transfer. Energetic 
transfer. What else? Independent transcendent  
flow-like state. Yeah. Independent transcendent 
flow like state. You got it. That was now 10.  
Yeah. What else? Well, what I'd always say is you 
want your inner cheerleaders to be on your team,  
right? So, I'm just showing you the inner 
cheerleaders that I have in my brain. This is like  
this is like the Owen like this is like Owen like 
some pom poms like woo. Go for it. Get this get  
the touchdown. That's what that's what I'm trying 
to show you guys. How to get the touchdown. So,  
you know, I always tell people as a joke, it's 
a joke. A joke is that fake confidence is better  
than real confidence. Really what I'm trying to 
do is lead you to the conclusion that, you know,  
choosing to be confident is the real confident. 
Okay? But we tend to think that we have to have  
the Lambo or the body or the money already to be 
confident. That's not true. It it's it's an inner  
dialogue that you can choose to engage in at any 
given point. You can choose to engage in better  
inner dialogue or worse inner dialogue. Right? 
It's like um again like the the messages in the  
water thing. Um I don't even know if that's real. 
Very likely not, but maybe it is. I'd have I'd  
like to dig deeper on that one. But it basically 
said that like, you know, if you said I love you  
to a cup of water, it develops all these really 
cool little snow crystals. And then if you say I  
hate you and [ __ ] off, then it's u it develops 
all these like weird brown things in it. I don't  
even know if that's true or some weird new age 
[ __ ] cuz new age people just say all sorts of  
[ __ ] You speaking like this, you're doing the 
exact same thing with the energy and your your  
body is an energy system and that's what you're 
doing. Yeah. So that's why I brought it up, right?  
Yeah. So you get it, right? So whether or not that 
is true, sometimes it's just better to believe it.  
So even though I'm not even sure if that messages 
in the water snow crystal is [ __ ] more of this  
new age [ __ ] or real, I'm just going with that 
it's real. Does that make sense? Cuz some things  
you need to research, but does it really impact 
you if it really has the snow crystals or not? No.  
Okay. It's just a belief that you're some beliefs 
you want it real accurate. Some are just a belief  
that's on your team anyway. You're just better to 
believe it, right? So that belief that um you know  
the snow crystals are the snow crystal comes from 
saying I love you. You're awesome. You're amazing.  
You have potential. You can fight through this. 
You can find solutions. You can believe if you  
have that in your brain. What does that do to your 
system? What happens when you get around the wrong  
people? People that demoralize you. People that 
scare you. Right? There's a degree to which you  
might want to be scared to assess liability and 
threats and not just bury your head in the sand  
like an ostrich, but that should be intermittent 
periods of liability assessment and understanding  
the the the playing field better, understanding 
the lay of the land better. Abso fuckingutely  
know where the rocks are. If you're in a boat, 
you know, if you're in the Titanic, you might  
want to know where the [ __ ] iceberg's coming. 
Don't just be like believe driving the iceberg.  
But simultaneously, while that is true that you've 
got to be assessing risk and liability, you don't  
need this overactive amydala just hypervigilant 
all the time in a state of [ __ ] paranoia,  
constantly seeing obstacles, never able to be 
promotionoriented, always preventionoriented.  
You want to be promotionoriented. You want to 
see opportunities and you want to believe in  
your potential. So the way that I view it and I 
jokingly say have fake confidence. What it simply  
means is study the structure of confidence. So you 
remember I started this by talking about you and  
the then the shifts in thinking that we kind of go 
at that are hyper [ __ ] potent. When I'm teaching  
somebody, these are the mindsets that I'm trying 
to infuse the person with or to inculcate them  
with or to indoctrinate them with or whatever 
you want to call it in a positive version. Um,  
I'm trying to get that in your head and get you 
around that energy. I'm trying to create that  
kind of energy and get you around that. And if I 
can get you around that for, you know, a period of  
time, it starts to get in the mind a little bit, 
maybe those little snow crystals form or whatever  
the [ __ ] and you become a a different version 
of yourself and a more evolved, a more powerful  
version of yourself. And look, it's not for 
everybody. Like again, if you're satisfied playing  
[ __ ] Morowind and smoking a joint and you got a 
bottle of Vaseline and a [ __ ] sock and that does  
it for you, I'm not trying to make you put down 
the crusty sock. If you like that crusty sock,  
man, bust some loads in the sock, okay? If that 
works. But in my case, I tried and as many socks  
as I could [ __ ] crust up and, you know, try 
to drink beers while watching my dad and stuff,  
it just didn't do it for me. I I just didn't find 
it helpful. So, I began to look at other ways  
and via the process of coaching and so on and so 
forth. Uh what happened was he likes the he likes  
the crusty sock jokes. See? So, so he found you 
something to live for. List crusty socks. Yeah.  
I like that you said it just wasn't enough. Yeah. 
Yeah. Just like I just like I just fill the sock  
and I'm just like what's the purpose of this? 
Like I need more. It's just really not that.  
So you keep crusting the sock more, but no matter 
how much crust you get, you just are asking God,  
"What else is there, God?" And so it's just not 
enough. So I guess what I'm saying is um for me,  
like I I had an understanding that like I'm not a 
rich kid. I'm not I'm not someone who's like super  
good-looking or some [ __ ] right? I'm kind of 
like a little garden gnome. So I understand that  
about myself. So I I got that and then I said, 
"Do I accept this?" Like, do I just accept that  
this is my life position of not being a rich kid, 
not being a gigachad, not really having purpose,  
being in this kind of [ __ ] up system, 
although there's a lot of great things in it,  
too. I understood that. I said, well, why can't I 
make a hobby about how to beat that, right? Like,  
how can I how can how can I change that in myself 
so I can have an amazing sex life, so I can make  
more money, so I can go travel, so I can go do 
what I want. And it doesn't mean that I'm going  
to be happy 24/7, but how can I train myself 
to be a little bit happier every single year?  
And what I found was just make it a hobby, right? 
It's like if you get an environment like this  
and everyone in this room finds that to be like a 
cool hobby, great, right? People think it's cool,  
they like it. You get a country like America 
where that's an underarching belief system  
of a whole country of the people who still 
believe in it. Um or you can just take the  
belief system of all the other people who just 
kind of give up and they get demoralized and  
that's that. and and it's fundamentally up to you 
what game you want to play. So what I do is I get  
myself around again best friends, best mentors, 
best mastermind groups, people that I coach,  
I just get around that and we kind of build 
that energy together. We build those little  
snowflakes in each other is is really what we do 
fundamentally. Um and by making that a process,  
we did some incredible things and um we've wound 
up seeing um incredible government policies get  
changed from people that we had influence with. 
We've seen things like um huge influencers,  
actors, business people go on to change the world. 
But as cool as that is and as more high-profile as  
that is, we've also seen like little shy guys 
that filling up a lot of crusty socks get to  
have sex with a real girl. Or guys that just hate 
their 9 to5 wind up making a cool little funnel on  
the internet, make an extra five grand a month and 
actually getting to travel around maybe living van  
life or doing some camping or having a little bit 
more fun, right? And you everybody's got to start  
somewhere. But we've also seen, you know, I've 
also coached guys that are mega rich on how to  
find that next level. So wherever you're at, it 
doesn't matter, right? Like you're where you're  
meant to be spiritually and in your evolution. 
You're exactly where you're meant to be. The best  
time to start would have been, you know, however 
longer ago, but the second best time is right  
[ __ ] now. So I would just say start it now. And 
again, like I said, potential, belief, optimism,  
recognition of liability, but taking personal 
accountability, taking control, massive action,  
love, unconditional love, unconditional love for 
yourself, unconditional love for other people,  
realizing the potential that you have, walking the 
path, watching components of your brain unlock,  
creating those unlocks, stimulating those parts 
of your mind to unlock, stimulating a growth of  
your core essence, your spirit, Your connection 
to your creator, your appreciation for life, your  
capabilities, your legacy, what you pay forward, 
the ability to laugh and laugh and laugh and have  
fun, the ability to smile, the ability to power 
through, taking challenges that come up and using  
those like a pole vault to leap up to the next 
level, knowing that God put that in front of you  
in order for you to transcend. seeing that as you 
being exactly where you're meant to be. Knowing  
the potential of human beings that even though we 
are literally sometimes mentally [ __ ] that we  
have such incredible potential, but we do have 
pragmatic things that we have to think outside  
of ourselves. Okay? We have to think outside of 
ourselves, guys. Okay? And so with all of that,  
the world is your oyster. It really is. It really 
is. So, like I said, what I try to do here,  
I'm just kind of like a freestyle rapper just 
letting you inside my brain. And can you guys  
now see why my kids are pretty pumped up? Yeah. 
Okay. So, I try to talk to you guys the same way  
I talk to my kids. And I shoot a video like 
this cuz I could be dead someday and my kids  
can watch it. They miss their dad. So, I give 
you guys that just to give you a little bit of  
insight in how we've tackled a lot of challenges, 
how we've gone so hard, how we found solutions,  
and the belief that you thousand% can live your 
own potential and leave your legacy and have an  
awesome awesome [ __ ] life. Okay, so that's just 
a little opening that I can do. just cut the brain  
open, slime you up with some brain, okay? And just 
giving you a little bit of my inner dialogue and  
how I approach this stuff. And I want to thank 
you guys for being here to uh pull it out of  
me. I appreciate you guys being here. I love you 
guys. Thank you guys very much. I appreciate it.
Appreciate it, guys. Thank you. Thank 
you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
