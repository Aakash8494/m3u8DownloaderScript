Guys, I'm going to show you [ __ ] here
that's going to make you millions of
[ __ ] dollars. You guys ready to make
millions?
>> Are you ready to make [ __ ] millions?
>> Okay, the [ __ ] the things I'm about to
show you guys could potentially make you
millions if you follow it. Okay, I have
many friends who have. I will show you
exactly how to become a millionaire
right now. Are you guys excited about
this?
>> Like for real excited or kind of half
excited?
>> How excited are you?
>> Really excited.
>> Okay, I'm going to give you Is it okay
if I give you some harsh feedback?
>> Yes, sir. Is it okay if we call out
exactly what's happening to you? We call
out the BS and we show you how to change
your life right now. Is that okay?
>> Okay. Because we got to go deep. We got
to get serious. We got to get locked in.
I look often a little bit angry when I
talk about this because I'm angry for
you. I'm going to be honest. I'm very
angry for you. I can't stand what I see
happening to the world. I hate it. I
don't like what's happened to you.
You're all better than this. You deserve
a life better than this. But not because
someone handed to you like it's
communism. But what rather what you need
is a map and the tools to know exactly
what to do. That's what you actually
need and for someone to tell you the
damn truth. From there, you're going to
be a brokie. I don't give a crap or have
any empathy for you at all because I
threw you down a ladder and you didn't
take it. Okay? If I throw you down a
ladder, will you take it?
>> I don't believe you. I don't believe
you. If I throw you a ladder at a map
right now, will you take it?
>> Okay, guys. Even though I'm hyping it
like some smurmy self-help guy, I do
live this. I teach it. It is real. I'm
trying to hype you up because we're in a
big crowd here. We're having fun. But
this is real. Okay? This is very, very,
very real. I got many friends who did
it. You saw my buddy Marcel. He I met
him when he was 19. He followed this
exact map. Okay? So, let me I'm going to
show you guys a couple of things of how
this works. Okay. The first one is that
I'm and I'm going to show you a whole
process of how to go from what's called
zero to one. Say 0ero to one. 0 to one.
>> Awesome. What does 0ero to one mean? It
means you're starting at nothing and
you're going high. But there could be
some of you in here that are also very
wealthy. If you're already very wealthy,
this will get you from 10 to 11 or 10 to
a,000. Okay? So, this can goes this
these same ideas can go from 0 to 1 or
they can go from a,000 to 10,000. It's
whatever you want to do with it. But I
literally will give you a math from 0 to
one. All right. First thing you got to
understand, jobs are [ __ ] They're
not real. They're stupid. Okay? They're
completely stupid. Okay? The reason why
jobs are BS is this. Okay, if you Let me
break down the trap that you're in. I
want to show you the trap and change
your life right now. What's happening to
a lot of you guys in this room and again
many of you here are wealthy and this
does not apply to you. So when I say
you, okay, cuz I'm going to kind of say
you addressing people that are
struggling. If you're not struggling,
then be like, "Wow, some people are
really struggling. That sucks for them.
Damn." So you're going to actually get
intimately familiar with their struggle
and why they're screwed. Okay. In
reality, what's going on is that if you
have a job and you're working that job n
and I'm going to keep this quick cuz you
I think most of you get it, but I still
want to point it out. If you have a job
and you're working that job 9 to5 or
whatever, you are exhausted. Okay? You
are literally exhausted. And so what's
happening is you take the same commute
to work, maybe remote, but for a lot of
you commute, you go to work, right? By
the way, on the way to work, I'd
recommend listening to audio books. I if
I were you guys, I would be doing
marketing audio books and audiobooks in
every second you have. But the point is
that you're going to work and you're
zoning out and you're disassociating.
Say the word disassociating.
>> Okay? So you're disassociating on the
way to work. You're going into trance,
going into autopilot. It's not a good
look. Okay? It's not what you want to be
doing. So then from there, here's the
deal. So you go to work, you're
completely zoned out. The job is soul
sucking. I've had one job like that. It
was at Nordell. It's very similar to
Cisco systems. I wind up doing a speech
at Cisco once. Okay. I met the people at
Cisco and I remember I went to Nortell
and I had this uh a boss called
Guarshambo and maybe he'll see this
someone will pass it to him and some
he'll hit me up and I remember Gee okay
in Canada in in uh he was French
Canadian he said Owen
I want you to pull this is French
Canadian accent my best best impression
Owen we will go pull the wire and
basically what it was was that as an
intern I was taught to go under all
these kind of like mainframe stacks
computers that have all these different
wires that are stuck underneath and you
go in there and you cut up your hand and
you're digging into these like like the
floors are like 5 ft deep with all these
wires underneath and and it's like
removable tiles and you just sit there
removing wires. They jokingly would call
it pulling the wire as if it was like
masturbation, okay? Like pulling the
wire. And I was determined. I was like,
"Look, I'm at the cause of my results
and I want to get hired here for a
summer job. So, I am gonna bust my ass
every day and I'm gonna get hired for my
like $12 an hour summer job because I
want to get this on my resume and I'm
doing an internship. I'm getting a high
school credit for this. Okay, I just
want to jump in the video to let you
know I'm going to be doing something
absolutely incredible for you. Okay,
this is a herculean effort that I want
to do for you. Now, here's what it is.
Back in the day, I was flat broke. I had
no idea how to meet and attract new
people into my life. I was spiritually
bankrupt. I was just angry all the time,
pissed off at everything. And I was also
somebody who didn't know how to make
cash. And this really, really, really
frustrated me. And the thing that I
found that was the actual solution, the
very, very specific solution that I
found was realizing that trying to
fumble around by yourself learning all
of it never actually works and that you
can actually tap into other people's
experiences and basically just take the
fast lane right to the top. So, I wound
up attending basically every single
seminar almost on the market. I think at
this point there's probably some I
haven't attended, but I've attended
almost everything. And in the process of
attending it, I actually wind up
becoming a teacher and teaching many,
many, many seminars every year. So,
coming up this year, I'm actually going
to be doing a series of seminars. And
these are going to be completely and
totally for free. They're free events
that I do because frankly, it just
frustrated me so bad that many people
have never actually had this experience.
And if you're somebody who wants to have
this experience, I'm extending it to you
for free if you want to take the fast
lane right to the top. Now, I've got my
cities list. I've got actually 25 cities
coming up this year. Funny enough, the
next ones that I have coming up are
Austin, Dallas, Houston, Los Angeles,
Vegas, Boston, DC, Phoenix, and San
Diego. So, I've got some that are coming
up very, very, very soon. So, if you're
in any of those cities, sign up quick.
And then my cities list for the year,
which is totally insane. I can't believe
I'm doing this. About 25 of them. LA,
Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, Miami,
Austin, Dallas, Houston, Boston, DC,
Philadelphia, Denver, San Diego,
Seattle, Portland, Phoenix, Vegas,
Charlotte, Atlanta, Nashville, Salt Lake
City, Orlando, Detroit, Minneapolis, St.
Louis, and Honolulu. These are two-day
full events. They're absolutely insane.
Now, what can you expect to learn at
these events? Well, I'm going to give
you a little list right here, and here's
what you can expect to learn when you
come. There's four main topics that we
cover. The first one is OG social
skills, okay? how to get social
abundance. The second one is 8 figureure
personal brand. Okay, I'm somebody
that's done over 100 million sales for
my own personal brand. So, I want to
show you how to build a personal brand
with social media tools. The other one
is how to get wealth. Okay, how to get
paid. And the other one is modern-day
spirituality. Just to give you a little
bit of list of what to expect in the
social abundance part of the seminar,
we'll be talking about how to be
attractive, how to build a massive
social circle, how to understand the
psychology of the people you want to
meet, how to be charismatic, how to be
meet anybody anytime, anywhere, how to
use social media in order to scale that
and parties, how to scale that. In
business, we'll be teaching marketing,
sales, product creation, offers, calls
to action, how to control the frame,
motivation, execution, and how to make a
money-making ecosystem. In the personal
branding segment, we'll be teaching you
how to find your niche and purpose,
public speaking, talking to a phone or
camera in order to make video content,
complex storytelling, frame control, and
monetization. And then in the spiritual
enlightenment, what we call modern day
spiritual enlightenment part of the
course is how to use spirituality in
modern life, modern life. And by the
way, you don't need to believe in
spirituality. Just think of it as like
inner game, inner constitution, whatever
you believe. How to get present, how to
tap in and channel, how to bring
presence into action, how to be unfased
about anything, how to build a center
point that's proactive, how to become a
real person who actually has a will and
is not an NPC, which spirituality is
really the foundation of that. How to
recognize the energetic energetic
composition of whatever it is that
you're approached by. So, you know what
to predict and how to predict people's
behavior based on their energy, how to
let go of trauma, how to raise your
vibration, how to attract a resonant
lifestyle with a higher vibe, and how to
increase your spiritual paradigm. So,
this is going to be a series of events
that I'm doing completely for free this
year. But here's what I need you to do.
So, the challenge with these events is
that people wind up signing up last
minute, and we've booked the venues for
this months in advance. So, if you want
to secure your spot, given that we
literally booked these these venues
months in advance, we can't just wait to
figure out who signs up last day. What I
need you to do right now is go sign up.
And what's going to happen leading into
this is we're going to be doing four
live master classes over Zoom. So, what
I want to do is I want to prepare you
for the event. So those four areas which
is OG social skills, how to make a ton
of cash, how to build a personal brand
and spirituality. We're going to have
four different master classes on each so
that if you want to, you have the
ability to attend these and actually
meet me in person and have me answer
your questions live this incredible
series of live events. And we're also
going to be building a little group
leading into it so you can actually chat
and get to know the other people that
are coming to the event. We're also
going to be sending you some very old
school videos that are really hot and
really spicy and really wild and we just
send those to you right away because we
also want to get you moving. So, it's
very very important that you sign up
right away because those classes also
fill up. We can only let a certain
amount of people in them so that we can
actually get some Q&A going. And it's
also important that you reserve your
spot. So, sign up early. Even if your
spot is a year away on the cities list,
sign up right now while it's on your
mind. Reserve your spot. Get in the
classes. Get the videos. Get the
conversations going and join the group.
Okay, let's start engaging. Let's make
this actually mean something. Let's make
this the single most important event
that you attend in your life. People are
very literally in tears by the end of
the free event. And I know that you're
going to be as well. Get signed up
early. Reserve your spot right now and
I'll see you in person at the free
event. So, I sit there for 3 weeks in
this almost like a meditation of
despair. Say the word meditation of
despair.
>> Meditation.
>> Okay. A job is largely a meditation
despair. I'm coming up with this on the
moment, by the way. It's not my stick.
I'm just telling you what I think.
Right. And finally, and I think this is
God's plan. I really believe it. I after
my arm is all cut up, sore, and annoyed,
and I've been working for six, seven
hours for free like a slave for these
people as an internship to help me to
learn about professional life. Georgbo
walks by. He goes, "Oh, O, I see you are
not working. You like to have the fun at
Nortell." And I go, "Gee, that's not
funny, bro. I work my ass off." He goes,
"Don't even worry. WE HAVE FUN in a
hotel. You don't even not need to work."
I go, "Gee, that's not funny cuz you're
going to say that and you're not going
to hire me for a summer job." I have,
you could check the cameras. I have
literally been working around the clock
pulling this damn wire out of the floor
plugging into mainframe computers. Like,
it's like these racks of computers,
right, at Nortell like these big
computer companies. I've done that for
you for weeks. And if you guys know me
now, do you picture me doing something
like that? Well, I learned real quick.
Look, I got a lot of insight from that
job. It's called don't get a job because
then what happened was I said you're
you're not going to give me the credit.
This is not fair gee. This is not fair.
And so he said, "Oh, don't worry." But I
knew I wasn't going to get a job. I knew
it. And here's what I realized that
moment. When you have a job, you are
absolutely at the mercy of some random
boss and some random assessment and
frankly things like likability and
things like charisma and you know how in
state you are and basically a lot of
weird politics where people take credit
for other people's work is often going
on. Now look who here who has a job can
relate to that? Put your hand up in the
air right now. That's you. So you've
seen this BS, right? The commute, the
lack of credit, other people playing
politics better than you getting credit.
It's also why I teach you things like
charisma and social skills because if
you don't build a business, at least you
can also get a raise. So that's why I
show it to you. But anyway, I realized
after after a day of pulling the wire,
what do you think I want to do when I go
home? I want to build a business. After
a day of pulling the wire, what do I
want to do?
>> Yeah, I want to pull the wire. Right?
The wire that they're joking.
>> So here's what I'm saying. You go home,
you pull the freaking wire. Okay? You
pull the wire and then you pull the
wire. Okay? So, what most people want to
do after a job is they smoke weed. Weed
is incredibly popular. Go look up Dr.
Amen. Change your brain, change your
life. Weed is so popular right now. And
everybody's like, "Yeah, weed's like an
herb." I've had girls literally tell me
like, "No, I'm in a health now. I smoke
weed." Like, "Yeah, I get my friends off
alcohol and smoking weed all day for
health. It's an herb." And look up Dr.
Amen. Change your brain, change your
life. He says it is worse for your brain
than alcohol. So, basically, if you're
smoking weed every day, it's the
equivalent of like you're drinking like
a six-pack or a 12-pack of beer every
day. It's going to disassociate you.
It's going to mess you up. I do think
it's uh God's plan for like it's the end
of your life and you're going to die and
you have glycom and you have back pain
and God put that there so you can die
high. Okay? So if you're dying, okay, if
you're in a cope, say the word mega
cope, say mega cope.
>> If you're in a mega cope, God put that
plant there to make your death less
painful. God created that. other plants.
Oh, um, poppy or, uh, you know, the
cocoa plant or whatever, right? So that
you can die, not in excruciating pain.
These are great, beautiful plants for
someone who's dying. Well, guess what?
When you're pulling the wire all day,
you are freaking dying. Okay, you are
dying. So that's why it becomes
resonant. I'm dying, so I got to make
this less painful. Society's run off
weed. Let's be honest. Uber drivers,
tag, not all of them, by the way, by any
means. That's all honest work. Uber
drivers, taxi drivers, etc., etc. Um,
people doing manual labor need
marijuana. Why? Because it they're
dying. Okay? Now, some of them have
pride in it. I'm not discriminating.
There's different millions of different
cases. There will inevitably be somebody
watching this video saying, "I love
driving Uber. It gives me flexibility."
I'm not saying that's everybody, but you
guys can understand like when I go here
and I check in at the hotel and I say,
"Hey, um, where's the room?" Or, "Let me
check in." That interaction ends very
quickly for that person. That's their
freaking life. And they've got to sit
there standing in a fluorescent lit room
disassociating and finding a way for
this to make sense. And what kind of
pulls it together is weed or things like
weed, which are basically a plant as a
cope. God's plants for when you're
dying, but they are dying. And you are
dying when you have this kind of a life.
You are dying. Okay? Spiritually dying.
So then what happens? You go home. It is
not resonant for you to build anything.
You're exhausted. And let me put it to
you this way. Okay. So here's the first
lesson. It's a lesson that I got from a
video game called Ghost of Tsushima.
Okay? I've only ever played three video
games extensively. Horizon Zero Dawn,
God of War, and Ghost Sushima. I loved
all of them. It was actually worth it
for me. But a lot of people play video
games permanently. I can't. I played
that's all the video games I played ever
as an adult. Okay. So in try to follow.
Okay, guys. Ghost of Sushima. What
happens is you have you hit the other,
it's a ninja game. It's a samurai game.
And you fight these other samurai. Okay?
Say, "Fight the samurai."
>> Fight the samurai.
>> Say it louder.
>> Fight the samurai.
>> So, you're fighting the samurai. And
what you're I like it. And what you're
doing is you're doing these little taps
to get your opponent's shield to pop up
or to break. So, you're you're you're
tapping tapping tapping. Try to get
these little hits in so that your
opponent's shield breaks. What do you do
once the opponent's shield breaks? You
go a little tap or you do the heavy hit?
You do the heavy hit, right? Okay. So,
the analogy is that life the first layer
of getting rich is absolute value for
time. Say the word time is money.
>> Time is money.
>> But also say time plus focus is money.
>> Time focus is money.
>> Say time plus focus plus momentum is
money.
>> Time focus momentum.
>> So guys, look, even when I do events
like this, all that I'm Look, I'm in a
state of momentum right now. I don't
look like this all the time. I'm in
momentum. I'm in a state of I've put
aside the time to put to work on my
public speaking and my teaching. I put
aside a weekend to do it, right? So, I
put aside the time. I don't want to get
some BS phone call from staff or a girl.
I don't want to get distracted. I turn
off my phone. I tell the world to f off
and I lock it and I focus for three
days. That's why I schedule these, by
the way, guys. Okay? And I come in. I
practice public speaking. It's why I do
it practice teaching. So, I do these
events. Then though once I'm in a state
where I've got my time back, how focused
am I right now?
>> Out of 10, how focused?
>> Okay. And as the week thousand out of 10
and then from there as the weekend
progresses, how much momentum am I
getting into?
>> Mega momentum. Say this. All millions
>> Allions
>> are made with time management
>> are made with time management
>> plus focus
>> plus focus
>> plus momentum
>> plus momentum. [ __ ] anyone.
>> [ __ ] anyone
>> who steals my time.
>> who steals my time.
>> [ __ ] anyone.
>> [ __ ] anyone
>> who steals my momentum.
>> who steals my momentum.
>> [ __ ] anyone.
>> [ __ ] anyone
>> who depletes my focus.
>> Who depletes my focus.
>> Say a war for focus.
>> A war for focus.
>> A war for time.
>> A war for time.
>> A war for momentum.
>> A war for momentum.
>> So what that means is in effect you are
at a you are in a war of significant
others that make drama that want to
distract you. Friends that make drama
that want to distract you. TV, weed, Tik
Tok, all meant to deplete your juju.
Okay? It's meant to deplete your
freaking juju. And so what that means is
that the battle of money is this. You go
to work, you're depleted, and you want
to smoke the death plant, the plant that
God put here to help you to die. But
you're not dead yet. So you'll be stone
sober. Now, let me ask you a question.
I'm pushing 50, guys. Kevin turned 46
this week. Most people by 46, is their
brain sharper or more derpy?
>> Derpy.
>> Okay. But is that natural?
>> No.
>> In reality, if we scan my brain at 46
versus 26, would I have more neural
connections and synaptic superighway and
capacity for focus and ability to be in
momentum? Or would I have or would I
have less cuz I'm getting old at 46?
>> How much more?
>> Well, how long could I operate in this
gear here, do you think?
permanently. Say permanently.
>> Okay. So, I'm in a point where like some
kind of like runner from Kenya, my brain
just goes. And you'll observe that of me
as you watch me teaching this weekend.
You'll be like, "This guy's a freaking
nature." Okay? But I understood that
everything is out to deplete you. It is
a freaking war. It is hostile out there.
It is evil out there. It's also good out
there. And you got to get your time
back. So, what happens is this, like in
Go Sashima, you tap and tap and tap on
the shield. When the shield breaks, you
go in for the death blow. What that
means is that your first goal to get
rich as zero to one and but also even if
you're mega rich already, you want to
get mega mega mega mega rich is you've
got to get back your time. You've got to
guard it. You've got to fight for it.
You've got to believe in it. And that's
a function of something called
self-esteem. Say self-esteem.
>> Self-esteem.
>> Okay. Your time is worth something.
There's kind of a joke in information
marketing space where you know some guru
say a guy like Al Sherosi might say yeah
they offered me $50,000 for lunch and I
said no and people hear that they go no
you wouldn't say no to 50 grand for
lunch but they actually will in many
cases some case kind of like an upsell
but there's actually some truth in it in
many cases. Here's why. Because in
reality are you just going to go for
lunch with that guy or girl? Are you ju
are you really not going to want to like
think about their problems and so on and
so forth? A lot of people try to get me
to do one-on-one trading. I say no
because inevitably um here was a great
video by a friend of mine, Alex Becker.
Do you guys know Alex Becker? He teaches
uh uh Yeah. Okay. So he says the problem
with funny enough with video games. I
didn't even think of that. The problem
with video games is that you play a
video game. It's not the hours that you
burn on the video game. Follow this. Say
the word ambient thinking.
>> Ambient mental bandwidth.
>> Ambient mental bandwidth.
>> In other words, after the video game,
what's your brain unconsciously thinking
about? What do you think? Same about the
freaking video game or how to beat the
video game. So, you might have spent 4
hours on it, but it's not really 4
hours. It's really like 12 hours. When I
take a one-on-one client, I usually
don't want it in most cases because what
happens is I think about their problems
outside that time. Instead of the growth
of the business, I'm getting I'm paying
uh I'm trading time for dollars is
really my problem, right? So, that's why
I don't really like to do that. From
there, I do not want to trade time for
dollars. I want to be in massive
momentum. So, in other words, you know
what's funny about a guy like me, but
it's also common to people like me?
People will be friends with me and
they'll do something slightly
disruptive. Okay, thank you, bro.
They'll do something slightly disruptive
and I'll never call them again. And
they'll bump into me out at a bar and
they'll say, "Hey, man. I must have
offended you. Why did you never call me
again?" I go, "No, it wasn't even that
bad." They go, "Why would you never call
me again?" I'm like, "You don't get it?
Do you not guys? Let's put it this way.
I got three kids, right? Shouldn't Don't
my three sons deserve um let's uh could
you pass him that chair, my friend? Pass
him that chair. Don't my sons deserve my
time?
>> Should I be out at random meetups with
random people that don't respect my
time?
>> No.
>> So, what is my if if I'm going to not
spend time with my three sons or my best
friends
>> and I'm not going to be building my
business or helping my staff to get paid
more and my staff to get a raise.
DOESN'T MY STAFF deserve a raise?
>> Don't my sons deserve my attention?
>> Okay. Right. Shouldn't I even have a
moment for myself? God forbid.
>> So then if someone is not on point, I
can't talk to them.
>> Most of you guys, your friends will
gossip. Again, a lot of you in here are
rich, successful, etc., etc. You're not
at this point, right? So again, if I'm
saying that, it's not necessarily about
you, but try to have empathy for what
other people are dealing with. You got
What do you think I do as soon as
someone starts gossiping with me? What
does my brain do?
>> Tune out. How much do you think I'm
tuning out and saying no to on a
day-to-day basis?
>> I'm like a ninja. No. No. No, no, no.
Can you say the word police the garden?
>> Police the garden.
>> Okay. So, I don't want my I don't want
my time being burned on something that's
not scaling, but I also don't want my
ambient thought process being burned on
something not scaling. Okay? By the way,
a lot of the time when you built this
beautiful ecosystem, you'll bring people
into that ecosystem that don't
appreciate what it took to get there.
They have no idea. So, you might have a
girlfriend or a boyfriend and what
happens is you're sitting there and
they're arguing and they're in there
consuming a ton of money and living a
beautiful lifestyle. And what do they
say? They they start getting mad and
crying and being annoying and they say,
"Well, it's not about money. It's about
love." Meanwhile, okay, honey, then how
about you pay for this and I cry. How's
that deal sound? Right? So, again, your
partner, your significant other, if
they're distracting you, you are losing
millions on your significant other.
Would you guys mind if I even took a
slight side tangent of how real G's
manage relationships? Want to know how a
real G manage relationship? How ballers
and shot callers manage relationship?
Watch this. Okay, watch this. One
primary date per week at a predetermined
time. Phone is off. Total focus,
passionate love making at the end. Okay.
Then get them a therapist. Pay the
therapist. The therapist is someone who
you trust, not to alienate them from
you. What is the job of the therapist?
To let them discharge all their vomit
into the therapist. It's a puke bucket.
The therapist is holding a puke bucket.
Okay? I haven't had a puke bucket for me
in decades. But apparently people being
taken care of financially need a puke
bucket. Okay? Why? Cuz they never earned
it. So they don't respect their time.
And because they don't respect their
time and they just have good genetics,
they may have 10 out of 10 genes. So you
wind up dating them. But the point is is
that they don't understand that. So you
got the therapist holding out the puke
bucket. Puke, baby. Puke, baby. Puke.
Okay. Then what you do is you set up a
meetup with that therapist where she or
he, whoever it is, gets her issues off
the table within 1 hour flat. Now what
you've done is you've got the puke
bucket so that your partner doesn't have
to puke on you. You've got the meetup so
that all issues get off the table.
You've got the date, which is a 10 out
of 10 perfect date, and then total
attention. Now, when they go, "Baby, I
need attention." You go, "I can't wait
for Thursday. You're so sexy." You pick
a restaurant. You pick the best
restaurant in town. If you can't afford
that, you pick whatever. You hype it up.
You go, "Baby, I can't wait for our walk
internal park. You're so beautiful.
Like, every moment I can't wait to see
you." Maybe she gets mad. Baby, I care
so much about what you have to say.
That's why I brought in Dr. So and So to
hear about it cuz I want to hear every
damn word. If she's in a bad mood, I
say, "Baby, call the person." Okay, now
that these are the Okay, now people hear
this and then you know what they say?
They go, "Well, if your partner's that
bad, why are you even with them in the
first place?" Right? Look, I get it. A
lot of time I don't have just one
partner. And then you could just say
goodbye if they do anything. But let's
say at some point, God forbid, you want
a girlfriend. Most people do not do an
honest audit of how much of their time
is being wasted by their significant
other. Well, you know, is it like a
chore? Look, at some point you want
love. You got to have a baby with
somebody. So, set it up properly. Okay?
A lot of people object to this, but I'll
tell you this, and we were to ask the
women here, would you rather your man
has his phone on, keeps looking at his
phone, doesn't look in your eyes,
doesn't listen, but takes you out to
Pizza Hut every night while he just sits
on his phone mad, or would you rather
have something beautiful and so
exciting, and all week you get excited
for it, and then you dress up, he
dresses up, all the attention on you,
and then during the other time, he also
will meet up with you in a structured
environment, talk about any issues, and
then aside from that, he's building
something so that you're on the most
beautiful lifestyle that you could have.
Do you want that or do you want the
pizza?
>> The second option.
>> What's that?
>> The second option.
>> And would that allow you to maybe burn
less of your man's time?
>> Yes. How a different, more diverse life.
>> A more diverse life. That's right. Okay.
So, that is an example of saving time.
Again, a lot of people like, well, why
would you deal with someone if you have
to deal with that? People make drama,
guys. Okay. People make drama. Tik Tok
makes drama. News makes drama. It is a
battle for your time. Say battle for
time.
Battle for focus.
>> Battle for
>> battle for momentum.
>> Battle for momentum.
>> Say systems, not episodes.
>> What does that mean? You get in an
argument with your significant other.
That's an episode. Freaking forget the
episode. Built right away. Start
building a system that can minimize that
from happening again. Look, if someone
flips out, look, it's all good that you
flipped out. What's a system where this
stops? Because I need my time. It is a
battle for time, focus, and momentum.
Now, if I put aside a weekend here and I
turn off my phone and I lock in for a
couple days and I get into momentum
state, let's look what happens. Videos
get done, sales get done, experiments
get done, public speaking skills
improve. That's called setting aside
time. You guys who set a time aside time
to be here are learning, growing,
networking, getting information, getting
put in your head. You're going to do
better here over the next 3 days than
anything that you'd likely do anywhere
else in the world. Okay. Okay, this
event is free and yet this free event
will be a better event in my prediction
than even a 50k event with anybody else.
I'm going to make that prediction. I'll
ask you at the end of the last day.
Okay, you guys have been enjoying the
event so far by the way.
>> Thank you guys. I appreciate it.
[applause] Thank you. So guys, this
might sound extreme. Let me ask you
this. I just spent 5 years going to
every national park with my children. I
went to almost every national park in
the country. I skied almost every major
ski until I broke my leg. That was kind
of dumb. Private planes in Alaska flying
around with my kids. Best parties in
Hollywood Hills in LA doing some of the
best parties. Amazing dating life having
fun. None. Okay. I can afford
supplements that allow my mind to be
sharp as I get older. I have not been
sick in 14 years. So, I'm not saying I
can replicate that result for everybody
or that that's common. But you think
taking some very expensive natural
supplements might help? Do you want to
give your kids the best education? Do
you think it's a great education for
your children and family to get to go
see the country? Do you maybe want to do
a 5-year retirement like I did from 40
to 45 before deciding what you want your
ultimate legacy from 45 to 65 to be if I
happen to make it that far?
>> Well, then is it worth cutting off Tik
Tok and an annoying significant other?
>> Yeah.
>> What's it worth to you? Make a choice.
Get proactive. Audit extensively. Okay.
So, that's kind of the foundation is you
go to your job, you're freaking
exhausted and you're like, "Man, I don't
know what to do. this is driving me
like, you know, like I'm tired. I'm just
getting sucked in this [ __ ] like like
like this syrupy kind of plasma that's
just taking away my focus. Understand
that at the highest of levels, your
desire to master your time, that's
common with everybody. Okay, let let me
show Do you guys want to hear about the
secret society of the winners? Do you
guys want to hear what the secret
society of the winners is like?
>> Let me show you the secret society of
the winners. What it looks like. Okay,
so this is not necessarily with every
wealthy person. I'm just giving you an
example, but I'm going to go much
deeper. Who knows what kind of watch
this is?
>> What kind of watch is this?
>> What does that watch cost?
>> Uh 40 plus probably a lot more.
>> You did not know. What does this watch
cost, guys?
>> 120.
>> It's about 120,000 bucks, right? So,
it's called a Paddic Nautilus. 120,000.
This watch is dumb. This watch is not
even as good as many watches you get at
Macy's. Okay. But you can resell it at a
profit. I think I grabbed this. I think
I grabbed this maybe 110 120ish probably
running about 140 now if I want to get
out of it if I want to sell it. Okay,
they resell. Go to a paddic store, try
to buy a paddic, they won't sell it to
you. You bring 100 grand, they will not
give it to you. You've got you'd have to
buy you'd have to This watch is not
actually 100 G's. This watch is actually
you'd have to buy probably a million in
watches to get the paddic. Okay, so
basically when you wear a certain model,
it implies that you bought 500k or a
million watches. Got it, guys? So what
happens is why do you wear this silly
stupid watch? What is it?
>> Do I lose the money or make money off
this? Well, first of all, I can sell it
and get out of it at a profit. Doesn't
mean you always can though. You could
watch market could get soft. But why do
you do the watch? [clears throat]
>> Is it Is it for women? Is it that does
do any beautiful women know what a
paddic nautilus is?
>> Yeah. It's called a prostitute. Okay. Or
a stripper. Okay. That ain't my jam. So,
what who knows what a paddic nautilus or
an AP Royal Oak or a Rolex Daytona or a
Richard Mill? Who knows what that is?
who
>> rich dudes and women. Okay. So, what
happens is you go out a lot of these are
even made just of stainless steel like
the APs and and the the base level non
stainless steel. No one even knows it
is. Another rich guy sees it and they do
the same thing. Hey, nice paddic. Hey,
like the RMS, the Richard Mill looks
like a G-Shock. They're and then
everyone's so dumb. They're like, but
that looks like a G-Shock. That's the
point is so you don't get robbed, dude.
Okay, they do that. But people know what
that is. So what happens is you wear
that and then you network. Those people
might know a lot about upcoming stocks,
about crypto, about business, about
networking. So you go out to rich areas
and you network with those people.
Likewise, Marcel is super into cars,
right? You got a Lambo, you got a
Ferrari, you got a McLaren, you got a
Bugatti. What is the purpose of the car?
It's not to drive some farting loud car.
Guys, why do you drive the Lambo? What's
the purpose,
>> guys? What's the purpose?
>> It's just it's just networking, guys.
It's just a club. It's some dumb car you
don't need that's unnecessarily
expensive. Like like the the the
movement of the Hoderology in this is
unnecessarily expensive and not even as
accurate as your iPhone. It's like an
older technology. It's just hard to
replicate. So, what happens is you
network when you're out. Okay, look.
Simple way to put it, right? Funny
enough, if this is a free event, right?
If I do a couple sales here versus at a
paid event that is 15% the size, where
will I make more money? At a free event
this big or at maybe if I had if I had
only these two rows but everybody there
paid 5 or 10K at a low end, where would
I make more money in sales? The two rows
or a whole free event like this?
>> Why is that?
>> Say the word pre-qualified.
>> Pre-qualified.
>> Say it louder, guys. You got to know
this.
>> Say it louder. Prequify.
>> Nah, you're not ready. Y'all ain't ready
to get rich.
>> Pre-qualified.
>> Louder.
>> Yeah, it's all about qualified leads.
That's it. Okay. Look, when I do parties
in LA and I invite up incredible women,
people want to come to that party. Why?
Because those are women that are
screened as being not just beautiful
externally, but what kind of beauty are
we looking for in a pre-qualified party?
>> Internal.
>> Say louder.
>> Internal.
>> Say internal beauty.
>> Internal beauty.
>> Right. So, so how long does it take to
fill a room um say a party with women
that are not just externally beautiful
but internally beautiful? How much work
does that take?
>> HOW MUCH?
>> MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF WORK, RIGHT?
NETWORKING, PROSPECTING, getting to know
them, get vetting them, etc., etc. That
is why rich guys will pay 30,000 to be
at a table or a dinner party with those
women. They're looking for a mother of
their kids. They're trying to or maybe
they're trying to hook up, whatever,
right? But they're trying to find that.
They're looking for pre-qualified leads.
Um Joe Polish, an old school internet
marketer, he had a group. It was called
the 25k group. And another group was
called the 100k group. And guess what he
taught in those groups? What?
>> Internal views.
>> It's called the 25k group. What do you
think he taught?
>> Nothing.
>> What did he teach you to the 100k group?
[laughter]
Absolutely nothing. Why? What's he
actually What's What is the 100k group?
What is the 25k group? What is the
Virgin Lounge at the airport? Why do you
go in the Why do you pay 500 bucks to go
in the Virgin Lounge, just have a
membership for a year in the Virgin
Lounge at the airport, and then
basically pay 500 bucks? It's the exact
same thing as the main airport lounge.
>> It's so that no one will puke on you.
>> In the main, the masses in general, not
all of them. I love the masses. That's
why I'm passionate. argue, complain,
gossip, freak out, take drugs, steal,
dishonest, many of them. Okay? So, if
you don't have a $500 protection, then
you now are going to hear that Karen
beside you screaming at the attendant
freaking out. Now, occasionally you'll
get that in a in the Virgin Lounge, too,
because the 500 bucks, a couple
[ __ ] still got 500 bucks, but at
least it's less [ __ ] right? So,
again, what's the watch what's the watch
doing? What's it finding? Say
pre-qualified.
>> Pre-qualified.
>> Okay. What is the car fighting? What is
it?
>> Say pre-qualified leads. Say it.
>> Pre-qualified leads.
>> Okay. The the 100K. Okay. The 25K group.
What is it's just a network. What is the
What is What is the people you're
meeting in the 25K group? What is it?
>> Pre-qualified.
>> Say it louder.
>> It means they got 25K. The 100K group,
what does that mean? Say it again.
>> It means they got 100K. If you are rich
and you're in a room of people that can
pay 100K, then you get around the right
people. You make money from that. That's
why say the rich get richer,
>> the rich get richer,
>> the poor get poor,
>> the poor get poor.
>> What is F1 racing where you go to say uh
you know Europe or Vegas, whatever, or
in Florida, and you see these like
races, what does it cost to go to F1 to
some of the better areas in F1?
>> Come on, guys. How much you y'all see F1
Brad Pit movie? What's it cost to go to
F1?
>> What do you What's it cost to go to F1,
boys? Boys and girls, what's it cost?
>> 70K, 50
>> 70K, 50K. What do you rather do? Go to
New York Knicks game for $200 for like
higher level seats, maybe a thousand
lower seats or 35,000 watch a bunch of
race cars spin around you can't even
follow cuz going so fast just going by.
What would you rather do next?
>> Probably see next game, right?
>> Are they really there for F1?
>> No.
>> What are they there for?
>> They're just there to network. That's
it. Right. You go to Lamborgh
Lamborghini will have parties. They put
it on where everyone that has a
Lamborghini gets invited. It's a club,
guys. It's a club and y'all ain't
invited yet. And I got to get you in the
club. Okay. What is Burning Man? A It's
people that are into like uh in big
tech. They'll go out there, they do a
bunch of psychedelics and orgies cuz
maybe demon possession. And what
happens? I'm just saying maybe. And what
happens is they go in, they network and
they they make their next like um what
do you call the uh like the mark of the
beast system, AI takeover like central
control surveillance system, right? They
make millions of dollars off it. That's
why they go to Burning Man. They're not
there for Burning Man for the art
installation. Guys, wake up. Okay,
they're not going there for the art
installation. Okay, they're going there
to worship Satan and combine. I'm
kidding. But anyway, so yeah, I'm
joking. I'm completely joking. But the
point is, um, I'd actually like just to
go see it and wait in my own eyes. But
the point is this, okay? I like see the
crazy world. But the point is they go
there to network. So in other words,
you're pay what? Burning Man is
expensive. You pay a lot of money to go
to to the to the thing and you go and
then you can go. Okay. Now, here's the
way that it works. Once you get over the
hump, it's a lot easier to be very, very
rich cuz you're in the right circles.
You have the right advice. And by the
way, it's not just the right advice.
It's not just the secret information
that you got privy to. A lot of it is
frankly say the increased vibration. Say
that
>> increase vibration.
>> Like look, when you're around, I'm going
to try to simplify this. Okay? This is a
very deep topic. I've talked about it. I
don't want to spend a million years on
it, but just try to catch my gist. Okay?
spiritual ascension and not all business
owners spiritual by the way but you know
to be um you know to have ascended to
have expanded etc etc basically what
that is is two major qualities first of
all say you're more at the cause and the
effect say it
>> and second of all everything is easier
say that
>> everything is easier
>> now you know you ever work on your
social skills you go on a night out
you're talking to a million people and
on some nights it's just you're at the
effect and it's
And other times you go out and it's so
easy and you're at the cause. You can
feel you're in a different vibration.
And I hate that word. I can't stand that
woo stuff by the way. I liked it before
I was so popular. But you're in a
different vibration. So what? So say
vibrations are contagious.
>> Vibrations are contagious.
>> Spiritual energy is contagious.
>> Being present contagious.
>> Being presious.
So in reality, a lot of people who come
from brutal inner city environments,
they'll say they don't have the same
opportunities. They actually technically
do living in America. There's nothing
stopping them. But if you grow up around
a bunch of um assault and attacking and
drug dealing and gang banging and all
this stuff, that trauma is being dumped
into you and that's why it actually is a
disadvantage. even though in reality
they could just go get, you know, a job
and they have opportunities, but they
don't see it because the pain of it is
very very bad. So that's that's what I
think we don't talk about when people
come from poverty is how horrible it is
that you're around that low vibration.
And all y'all know that because your
friends have their own degree of trauma,
negativity, and syrupy derpy kind of
plasma around their brain that's
spreading on to you and infecting you.
Say the law of infection.
>> LAW OF INFECTION. SAY THE LAW OF
INFECTION.
>> THE LAW OF INFECTION.
>> You're being infected by positive. Say
infected by positive.
>> Infected by negative.
>> Right. So Echarolei, what was the name
of his second book? It's orange.
>> Say louder.
>> A newer.
>> Say it louder.
>> A newer.
>> What does that mean? It would mean that
we would all raise the vibration of the
earth. It's a dream, guys. Who knows,
right? It's a dream. Who knows? But the
idea, okay, we may hit AI before we
could do that organically. I hope we do
hit it organically. And I'm trying,
guys. I'm out here fighting the good
fight for you and for all of us.
>> Thank you. Okay. Thank you. Appreciate
it. I'm trying. [applause] So, right.
I'm trying. Cuz guys, when you get paid
on a when you get paid by a rich guy,
you can go do that free event, right?
People like, I want to help the world.
You make some money, you can go do a
free event, right? So, that's what I'm
getting at. Now, basically, what you
have from there is that you're getting
better advice. You're around a higher
vibe and your mind is more locked in and
focused. Now, when look, what have you
guys learned from when you go out and
socialize? When you feel high status,
you get present and you get into a flow
state and life is very easy. When you
take a bunch of rejections and you feel
crappy, you can barely tie your own
shoes. You can barely remember your own
name. So, your mission is to always be
in a present state, getting back time,
focus, momentum, getting in that state,
and fighting the good fight. In other
words, a lot of time when I work with
you, I do I do five six hours easy of
audits. Say five, six hours of audits.
>> I'll sit there auditing your life with
you for five, six hours honestly because
I've got to get you seeing where your
time is going and where all the leaks
are and you got to get on top of it. Now
look, I know a lot of y'all don't want
it. It's not for everybody. A lot of
people want to live a more go with the
flow life. And that's actually fine. And
you can even be quite successful like
that. But to go from zero to one when
you're stuck and you're trapped and
you're in a trap, you've got to get the
trap off your leg. And the problem is
the trap is so insidious because you go
to work, you come home, you're tired,
you're exhausted, you hate your job, you
got to pull that bear trap off your leg.
You don't realize you've got a bear
trap. It's very bad, guys. It really
does suck. But you can take it off. You
actually can, but you got to want to do
it. Okay? You got to be serious about
it. So then what happens is this. You've
got to find something that gets you from
zero to one and you can start making
money from right away. Here's why.
Because you need something to make money
that you can do when you get home after
being traumatized, bored, and spaced
out, and disassociated from your work
instead of smoke weed in your freaking
spare time. Here's the common elements
of those things that you'd have to do.
Okay? Repeat this after me. Say, "Time
efficient."
>> Timeic
>> because you don't have a lot of time.
>> You're fighting for all your time. It's
got to be time efficient. Um, another
one is say no gatekeepers.
>> No gatekeepers.
>> And another one is a crack in the dam.
Say that.
>> Crack in the dam. So what you do um let
me say another uh point to you and this
is pointing to a future point and then
we're going to cover that. Say the word
work is idiotic.
>> Say it louder.
>> Say it louder.
>> Work is idiotic.
>> And I'm going to make a correction. It's
actually great. Work is great. But say
permanent work is idiotic.
>> Permanent work.
>> Okay. So look, if you want to be rich,
all you got to do is get enough money
that you can put it into something that
pays you. So say you've got to build the
principle.
>> Build the principle.
>> Say, build the principle.
>> Say, don't eat the principle.
>> Don't eat the princip.
>> Okay. So look, if you got a lamb, say
you got two lambs, right? It's a little
baby lamb. And you look at it, you go,
I'm hungry. And maybe you are hungry. So
you try to bite it and eat it.
So maybe you got one meal from that
lamb. What if you had bred the lambs,
had a flock of lambs, got wool from the
lambs, and then eventually later you
could eat it when it's full grown. What
would be a better situation?
>> Okay, how about if you had an apple tree
and then you take the apple and it's
like a little baby apple tree and
there's a tiny little apple, but you're
starving to death. So you eat this like
marblesiz apple. What could that have
been if you let it grow?
>> What could you have got from the apple
tree?
>> Apple trees.
>> Other apple trees. So what could you
have ultimately got if you're smart
about it with the apple tree? What could
you eventually build?
>> Orchard.
>> An orchard. Right. The reason why
permanent I'll say work is dumb and
people don't believe me. They're like
that's crazy. You're not seeing it how a
rich person's seeing it. Permanent work
is dumb because what you're supposed to
do is build a principle that pays you
and then get back your time so you can
figure out what you actually want to do.
Okay? So say, "Build the principle.
>> Build the principle.
>> Live off what it pays you.
>> Get back 100% of my time.
>> Get back."
>> That's what it is, right? So you don't
need a business model that gets you to
billionaire status. All that you need is
something that gets you to having a
principle and then you get all your time
back. Imagine if imagine if you didn't
have to work at all, like not even at
all. And all that you could do all day
was just build your build your next
thing all day. Does that make sense?
>> So you So what basically what you got to
do is it's like scrambling up a
mountain. It's going to cut you up. It's
going to [ __ ] you up. It's going to mess
you up. But once you're at the top, life
is just easier. So, you've got to
rapidly rapidly get back your time, get
back your focus, get back your momentum
because these people and these
influences that are holding that stuff
back and lowering it are going to put
you in a lifetime of work. You're going
to work till the day you die in this 9-5
trying to get a retirement and barely
have any money. And Sid is here, guys.
Sid is really sid out there because I'd
love for him to say something about this
here. Okay. Well, Brandon, can you check
if Sid's here cuz he knows this stuff.
He may be out. He might be eating dinner
with Marcel. Sid actually he does
mergers and acquisitions and some of his
acquisitions are old people's homes and
it is hell on earth. Say hell on earth.
>> Hell on earth.
>> He was managing private ones that are
even pretty expensive and government
ones. The private ones even with like 10
grand a month, whatever it was, I could
ask them the number were [ __ ] and the
government ones were mega [ __ ] So
basically what you're doing is you're
working till you're 65, guys. Look, I'm
turning 46 this week. Time flies by. It
flies by so fast and then eventually
you're stuck in some old person. Either
a government one that sucks or maybe a
private one that kind of still sucks.
It's really bad. Okay, so you've got So
you don't understand the stakes here,
guys. You got to wake up. Okay, you got
to you got to wake up. You got to
understand the stakes what you're
dealing with. Okay, they don't tell you
about this because they want you in this
like Rockerfeller system just basically
being the modern day slave. But I'm
showing you something at from a higher
paradigm here, okay? of how to become
more the cause is not the effect and how
for life for to be for it to be easier.
So then what you do is you have that
money and you can use all your time.
What can you build if you just have all
your time to do a business? What can you
build?
>> Say the word anything.
>> Say it louder.
>> Say it louder like you believe it.
>> Yeah, you actually can. You really
really truly can. You could build
anything. So that was the nice thing for
me was once I got my business cash
flowing by age 22, 23, I could just
build. Do you guys know how many
seminars I've been to? How nice is it
that I can go to every expensive seminar
I want, learn at the feet of the
masters? Like you guys see me up here.
Do you understand the millions that I've
spent on self-education because I can
float. So I can go to get mentors. I can
go into networks. Hey Sid, real quick,
just super quick. How much I was just
saying standard retirement,
private or government where everybody's
probably going if they get older without
a business. How much does it suck? You
got to use this. Just stand here.
>> Well, if it's the government in Colorado
too much
>> in Colorado, what would happen? I would
see [ __ ] stains on the walls.
Piss smell terrible. It's like hell some
of these places. Not all of them. Not
every government-run nursing home is
shitty. But if you can't afford private
pay, private pay means you got enough
money to buy get your own uh uh nice
luxury resort nursing home. The shitty
ones are pretty shitty. Yeah. And and
and and how would you describe this life
for them at the end of their life
thinking that if they worked a job their
whole life they'd be okay. How do you
describe it? Marc, I'd love to get you
up here, too.
>> So, a couple things. We have this like
you're in your 20s, you're in your 30s.
Do we ever think about what's going to
happen to us after 65?
>> It's It's almost like we're It feels
like we're just going to live forever,
doesn't it?
>> I'm I just turned 30. I couldn't believe
I turned 30. He's 45 right now.
>> 46 next week.
>> 46 NEXT WEEK.
>> LET'S GO.
>> YEAH. MARCEL, I REMEMBER MARCEL. I met
Marcel when he was 21. He's still young.
He's 27. [laughter] He's the one young
guy in the room. But the point is, time
passes by. It passes by really quickly.
By the time these guys were, you know,
65, they're they're they think their
friends, their family's going to come
visit them. They're just rotting away at
the nursing home. And most of them don't
have friends or family to visit them.
And that's actually why they die early.
>> They die within 5 years nursing home.
That's actually the stat.
>> It's because they're lonely.
>> Five years.
>> Five years. Say say it again.
>> So they they die within five years of
going to nursing home because they lose
connection and connection is what keeps
you happy.
>> Social skills is what keeps you bonded.
Now imagine never developing those
skills. You maybe get married to someone
out of desperation. They marry you for
the same reason. You can't maintain the
dynamic because the same thing that
creates the dynamic is what maintains
the dynamic, right? So then you end up
getting old. No one comes to visit you
because you have a broken household.
your kids don't give a [ __ ] about you
because you're constantly yelling at uh
you're constantly yelling at at your uh
spouse, they're fighting and they leave
and you get divorced. Ultimately, you
end up just dying younger. Actually, if
you have a great home, a great
relationship, and you have great kids,
you'll live a longer life. Like, you
will like my parents will never go to
nursing home.
>> I don't give a [ __ ] They're g they will
never go there.
>> So, see Marcel's taking it to another
level. He's going to dodge a nursing
home, but also his parents get to dodge
the nursing home.
because they did a good job, right? My
parents been together for 33 years. My
dad transparently didn't have me till he
was 48, not because he couldn't. Okay?
Like 48. He did what he did. My mom 38
when she had me. So my parents had me
late. My mom couldn't have kids. The
only reason I was even born is so put me
in in vitro. And the first time it was
even possible was her age at 38. I was
me and my sister were first twins to be
born in California from in vitro, like
ever. So, it was very, very, very new at
the time. Long story short, and the
Nazis invented it, by the way, which is
ironic, right? I'm Jewish, so they they
invented it by experimenting on Jews.
But anyways, so little did they know
what was coming.
>> Yeah, the super Jew.
>> Yeah, there we go. The Aryan. No.
Anyways, [laughter]
if I was blonde blue eyes, it' be
perfect. But the point being, if you
don't develop these skills early on, it
it doesn't just affect your happiness
now. It affects your happiness long
term. It's guys, if if you want to know
why I'm the best hypnotist in the world
and why I'm a good speaker and why I
have confidence and charisma and all the
above, it's because of how I practiced
and developed my social skills.
Ironically, the same background goes for
Sid and for Owen and for Tony Robbins
and for Grant Cardone and for every
massive speaker in the world. All of
them started with their social skills,
developed it, and then went on to
becoming massive titans. Tony Robbins
and Grant Cardone, both billionaires.
Both are billionaires. Okay, I can tell
you Tony Robbins, and Grant Cardone are
two decades older than Owen. So, what
happens in two decades? What happens for
me in about three and a half decades or
four decades? Right? And Sid, same
thing. Think about the compounding
effect of having the social skills
dialed in. Because at the end of the
day, it doesn't have to be where you it
doesn't have to be to where you rot away
at a nursing home. Why can't you have
the light shooting out your eyes and
feel present and have family?
What happened to Warren Buffett? Is he
not sharp at 80 or 90 years old?
>> Like 99 or something?
>> Yeah, he's extremely sharp still. What
do you think is gonna happen to him? I
mean, it's Have you met too many? Have
you met 46 year olds that have his level
of sharpness? Not too many. It's It's
rare, but you got to keep on you got to
stay on the path. And it's not just
social skills. It's about staying
mentally sharp. It's about continually
accessing flow states that trains the
brain. It's like exercise for the brain.
By the time you're older, you'll have an
advantage that most other people are not
going to have. And he's talking about
compound interest. Compound interest is
a force to be reckoned with. If you are
compounding in your energy, your focus,
your momentum, your your skills, your
friends, it's an upward spiral. Dopamine
tes, you know, testosterone eventually
does go down, but those things at least
you have a solid base of that that
momentum will bleed by the uh bleed into
your older age. By the time
>> the word compound interest
>> interest,
>> what are you doing? [cough]
So by by the time you're older, what
most people can't like what does the
average life look like right now if they
are losing energy because of bad food,
drugs, alcohol, the wrong friends,
gossip,
a a job that they hate that they can't
access flow through. They come home,
they watch Netflix. That is a downward
spiral that most people are in.
>> Guys, aren't we better than this?
>> Aren't we better than this?
Unless you actively rebel against the
condition, the negative conditioning
that's put on you that is seeping your
energy, you won't be that sharp Warren
Buffett type person, your own equivalent
of it. You're not going to be that
person by the time you get older. And
guess what?
The enemy of the best is what?
>> The good. So the enemy of the best is
the good. Look at Kobe Bryant. Look at
Warren Buffett. Look at these guys who
got better as they hit middle age. that
is not probably not even your parents to
be honest with you. And because we don't
have references of people that are
operating at that level, we think the
references are [ __ ] and then and we and
we just stay in that cycle or we watch
self-help content and don't actually
come to a room like this where you get
attuned to higher levels of energy and
then you don't even know what the other
side looks like. You have to not just
watch this in a video. You have to do
what? You have to feel it. Everybody say
feel it.
>> To feel it means we're using our six
sense, our energetic sense. You feel
something is different in the room. the
way our eyes look, the way we walk, the
way we talk, the way we act, that all
bleeds and seeps out of our pores. And
until you are around a real high
performance person, you don't know what
it looks like.
>> Guys, look at how fast, just so you
know, look at how fast without a
warm-up, look at how fast it got into a
flow state. I'm just saying like it's
it's on tap. Like you just you need your
brain operate at like 100 miles an hour.
It's on tap.
>> And guys, this is a war. You know why?
You know why this is a war? Because the
world needs to wake UP WHEN?
>> NOW. NOW. WHEN? [screaming]
>> NOW.
>> WHEN?
>> NOW.
>> WHEN?
>> NOW.
>> WHEN? [cheering]
>> NOW.
>> WHEN?
>> NOW.
>> WHEN?
>> NOW.
>> WHEN?
>> NOW.
>> WHEN?
>> NOW. [screaming]
>> NOW. SAY IT.
>> The world needs to wake up now or we are
[ __ ] Okay. You're looking at a old
ass man with a gray beard trying to get
the the environment that my children
will grow up in not [ __ ] It's a
[ __ ] war to get people to wake up.
>> Okay. It's a [ __ ] war. But it's not
just about them, it's about you.
>> You know, I I'll invite you guys to
think about this. If you've ever had it
where even on accident, even for five
minutes, maybe you were popular,
everything was working out. I I'll tell
you, there's two ways this can happen.
Think of it. Think of it as like Satan's
energy, anger, and then there's there's
heaven's energy, right, which is a love
and abundance. Okay? Sometimes people
confuse Satan's energy for heaven's
energy. And what that looks like is
this. When I was 17, I got heartbroken.
I had a girlfriend I was madly in love
with. And she lives in Brazil. She went
back to Brazil. After about 14 days, 12
and a half days, I wake up in the
morning and I feel this heaviness in my
chest. And I was already heartbroken
that she left at the airport cuz I knew
I would probably never see her again. I
couldn't afford to get her a flight. And
I wake up in the morning and I felt like
something was wrong. Couldn't figure it
out. I texted her. I'm like, I had a
really weird dream. And finally clicks
in my head. I'm like, she was with
someone else. And I texted her. I said,
you were with someone else last night.
An hour goes by and she responds. She
says she was and that was a Friday night
or Friday during the day. I go out at
night to a party and I'm at this party
and for some reason, this never happened
before. Girls, I didn't want to talk to
anyone. I was I was completely
heartbroken. I've never felt so bad in
my life. Girls were walking up to me,
taking my hands, grabbing my private
parts, taking my hands, putting on their
private parts, like fighting over me.
And I'm just in this haze and I'm trying
to just like, "Please don't touch me.
like leave me alone. But because I was
carrying such so much pain, right? So
much darkness, right? Like Satan's
energy, right? This devil's energy.
It radiated and a lot of people
resonated with that. The And the girls
that were resonating were the ones who
were drunk, were on drugs, like the
weird like the the negative ones, right?
And it just drew them in like a magnet.
And that's what I attracted. And all I
was seeing was a reflection of what just
hurt me. I was seeing a reflection of
the exact same patterns in these women
that I would see in the girl that
actually just cheated on me, right? And
because of that, I realized that this is
such a negative state that I became
allergic to it. I cannot be a part of
that. And instead, what did I end up
doing? I ended up saying, I need to
associate to heaven's energy, which is
the opposite. I forgave her, still loved
her, and said, "Okay." And guess what?
All those women that came up to me and
were grabbing my hands, trying to touch
my private parts, all that, right? just
being crazy. Stop talking to me. And the
only women I attracted are women that
came from an amazing household,
unbelievable self-confidence and love
and incredible loyalty. But in order for
me to understand the two paradigms, and
let me tell you what it looks like in
business. In business, you look at like
a Wolf of Wall Street. I see that movie
and I think Jordan Belelffort's a piece
of [ __ ] I think he stole people's
money. I think he's a [ __ ] scammer. I
think he literally is a selfish piece of
[ __ ] and he brainwashed a bunch of
people who resonated with Satan's
energy, drugs and strippers and
prostitutes and then they sold it in a
movie where a bunch of people are like
that movie is awesome. And I say that
because here we are in New York and
people resonate with Wall Street and
they think that's what Wall Street's
about. That's what success is about. But
the truth is that guy's trash and he
ratted everyone out for helping him even
though he was the mastermind. He ratted
everyone out to have a shorter term in
prison while everyone else got [ __ ]
And then here he is now doing his own
thing, still on drugs and all that. And
people like, "Oh, I love the wolf. I
don't like him because I think he's a
piece of shit." Now you take that same
guy and you look at the inverse, which
is caring, charitable. You want to
donate money. You care about people. You
lift people up. You You take them away
from drugs. I'm allergic to the idea of
drugs. I'm allergic to alcohol. I hate
all this [ __ ] Smoking. Hate it. That's
why I'm the best in the world at making
people quit in two seconds, right? I'm
allergic to it. That level of energy
attracts a different paradigm. That's
why in my business, I attract a
different caliber client. I have people
pay me a million dollars, right? And
80,000, 100,000, 50,000, 30,000. Right?
That's the caliber I'm getting because
I'm attaching to a higher paradigm.
>> Guys, what kind of lead is that?
>> AGAIN,
>> PRE-QUALIFIED.
>> AGAIN,
>> PRE-QUALIFIED.
>> Could you could you explain briefly how
you know you have like the Lamborghini
club, like the car clubs, and then you
get pre-qualified people? Very quick.
Long story short, it takes it takes some
effort to get, you know, a Ferrari, for
example, or like a more exclusive car.
Uh, because I'm buying this Aston Martin
Vajala, which is a million-dollar Aston
Martin, and you need $400,000 deposit to
even build the car. I'm invited to an
event in LA next weekend where the only
people who are coming are people who
also put a $400,000 deposit to the
Holla.
>> Yeah. And guys, knowing what you know
about Marcel with sales, right? If he
can get into a room with people that
have that, what's he going to close them
on for coaching? Anybody here do
coaching? Put your hands up. You're a
coach. Not a s. You do a coach. Okay.
So, Manny, you do some coaching, right?
>> Imagine that you were around that
audience of people and you resonated
with them spiritually
>> and you you had the same kind of
attunement for time as what they had and
now you're around them. Can you close
them at 84K a month for a million bucks
for maybe a call a week? Bro, the same
bro, the same amount of work but the
pre-qualified leads. But you've got to
have that caring about your time cuz
bro, they're going to feel in two
seconds if you don't value your time cuz
they're they're going to poke at you and
negotiate with you. And if you don't
value your time, they're going to sense
it and they're going to get you down on
your price. You got to also spiritually
resonate and you also got to find them
in the right place.
>> I had a client pay me a million dollars
off of an ad he saw. He's like, I'm
paying that guy a million dollars. He
was convincing my sales team, please,
please, please. They made him put 40k on
a credit card before he wired the rest
just to even get on the phone with me so
I could talk to him and see if I'm even
interested in working with him. Right?
That same guy referred to a friend of
mine for marketing. He negotiated my
friend from 4K down to 2K. Why? Because
my friend was such a [ __ ] on the phone
and resonated with the negativity that
Manny Manny Manny a mill versus gets
price dropped from 4K to 2K. If you need
that 2K, they sniff it out. They push
you down. If you're in a low resonance,
they know that you're broke. They push
you down. If you don't value your time,
they feel it. They push you down. And
so, look, in the same way, a lot of time
club promoters, like some dorky, like
not conventionally attractive club
promoter will be around a bunch of
models and he's dating all these models
cuz he's around the lead base, right? To
be honest, he probably does coke with
them and they do coke, but the point is
he's around the lead base, right? But
that guy might not have any swagger, but
dates models cuz he's around the lead
base. So, I'm trying to show you guys
about how to get around the lead base.
And that's what Marcel is good at,
getting around the lead base. If you
want to attract better leads, period in
your life, okay, better dating life,
better clients because at the end of the
day, a better client will spend less
money with you or spend more money with
you for less effort. Okay? A better
woman will make your life easier. You
know how you know you have a good
relationship. It's not hard. If it's
hard and you have to be like, "Don't
talk to that guy. Don't go out to the
club. Don't do drugs. It's the wrong
girl." Period. Wrong guy. You don't have
to change him. Take it as it is and
that's it. If you have to change it,
you're operating at the wrong level.
Okay? You're only resonating with the
wrong level. Now, at a higher paradigm,
when you understand what it is and you
carry that vibe, people know you're in
that vibe. For people, like when I walk
on stage, does anyone here sense that
I'm desperate for money? Do I look like
I like genuinely? Does it look like I
[ __ ] care?
>> I swear. Just honest. Okay. Now, do I
like money? 100%. 100%. If if there's
money, I want it. But I don't need it.
It's a different mindset, right? I'm
honest, though. I'm not going to lie
about it. I'm not going to be like, "I
don't I don't want [ __ ] money." That
guy, that guy wants money. If they're
saying that, they're a liar. I think
money's good. He thinks money is good.
If you have a good relationship with
money, you think money's good, you're
going to ask for it. That being said,
when you are in that mindset and you're
like, "You know what? If I'm going to
put my time in there, might as well get
the best." Why not spend your time
instead of spending my time in a a
networking event like on uh what's that
app called? [ __ ] Uh
>> LinkedIn,
>> not even LinkedIn. Meet whatever it
doesn't matter. some [ __ ] random app
where everyone's like not making their
rent this month. Why not just spend
400k, buy a car that'll appreciate
double? So, in other words, it's it's
not just free, okay, to own the car for
a million dollars. I drive it for a
couple years and then I doubled my money
on it. I made money getting into that
room. That's the irony of this
situation. The irony is I spent so much
money with Aston Martin, I now have an
invitation to buy Vajala. I get the
Vajala, spend a million dollars in the
car. In a couple years, the car is worth
$2 million. So, I made a million dollars
driving the car, getting into the room,
and making millions of dollars in
connections as well. So,
>> so guys, what you need is first of all,
say a vibe of value for your own time.
>> A vibe of value for your own time.
>> A high vibe of being at the cause and
the effect, not the effect.
>> A high vibe of being the cause, not the
effect.
>> A high vibe of where life is easy for
you.
>> A high vibe where life is easy for you.
>> And prequalified leads. And we need
>> the key too is what actually is shifting
your energy to where a client would
resonate with you.
>> The core is do you actually believe in
the product or the surface that you that
you've cultivated. What is the value
that you've actually cultivated? Not
just in your communication and how you
pitch it because that's also at the
technical level. That's also like trying
to force your girlfriend to not cheat.
It's at that paradigm. The reality is if
you put real value behind the product,
does that change your psychology when
you go to sell? Does that change your
energy? Does that change your
communication skills? Does that change
the way you negotiate? Does that change
the way you value your time? So,
cultivate what you believe in your heart
to be real value and watch as it knocks
down the dominoes of all these other
effects.
>> And by the way, what would you say? How
would you kind of describe how we feel
in this reality? You know, they were
perfect. We got our own. I got big
problems. We all got big problems. All
of us have problems, right? All of us.
But there's a quality of problem, right?
We want to raise the quality of problem.
How would you describe what it's like
for myself, Marcel, yourself being in
this reality, seeing other people? Like
for me, it's almost like seeing kids
even though they're adults. It's like
adult level kids.
>> How do you feel about it?
>> A couple different things. So, at at the
core of it, yes, on a technical level,
do you have the knowledge? Do you have
the skills? Do you have the connections?
If you don't have those three things,
that's what he's saying when he's
saying, "I view you as a kid, but you're
in an adult body." So, if you don't have
the right knowledge, the right skills,
the right connections, and you don't
have clarity in which and the direction
you're heading and alignment with that
and the communication skills and the
psychology around all of that, then that
is the technical side of what you might
be missing. But on the energy side of
it, at your core, when when Marcela is
saying there's heaven and hell, life or
death, black or white, there's positive,
negative, pain or pleasure, upward
spiral, downward spiral, winter effect,
stifled, we're all dealing with either
that upward trajectory or that downward
trajectory. So, at your core, in the way
that you communicate with people,
obviously, you can have that whole
structure I just talked about with the
skills, connections, all that stuff I
just talked about. What is the quality
of your interactions looking like within
that? And for us, the way we feel is it
feels like outflow.
Like our cup. One sec. One sec. One sec.
One sec. Our our cup runth over with
energy.
We we have so much energy to give, to
share, and not to take. And if every
interaction is done that way, well now
people, customers, employees, everybody
that you deal with on a in business on a
day-to-day basis, they can feel that off
of you in the energy. And then on the uh
other layer to it, they can see it in
your eyes. They can see it in your vocal
tonality. They see it on all the
subcommunications and all the
microtells, but they just sense a good
vibe from you. And guys, who taught the
idea of the cup is over? Who taught it?
[clears throat]
>> Louder.
>> Jesus.
>> Louder.
>> Jesus. ladder.
>> Jesus,
>> it's truth.
>> You know, at the beginning of the event,
remember I told you guys for maximum
rapport, the key is confidence and you
need nothing from anybody else. Remember
that. When you need nothing from anybody
else, that key is exactly what he said.
You're here to give, not take. If I need
something from you, I'm here to take
from you, right? But if I'm paying for
dinner, if I'm giving value, if I'm here
offering, who doesn't want to be around
that, right? If in a relationship, if
you're giving good vibes, you're giving
good energy, not insecurity, not
pressure, not stress, people want to
receive. They'll be magnetized to you.
They'll even pay for it because it's so
[ __ ] rare.
>> And addicted.
>> Everybody wants to take. So, if you have
that one quality, it just exudes
confidence and value and it's addictive.
Now, if you're people pleasing, is that
the same thing? No. It's an illusion. If
you're people pleasing, you're you think
you're giving, but all you're doing is
looking for validation. you're still
looking to take something. I don't care
if I'm going to get your validation. For
example, when I give someone uh a
homeless lady money, I don't need to
wait for her to say thank you so much
and film the [ __ ] thing and be like,
"Hey, did you like that?" I don't need
anything in return. I'm just happy to
give it and then leave.
>> He's in training the outflow, by the
way. Say that word, entrain the outflow.
>> Okay? So by giving again from the Bible
from Jesus but it's not the first we've
all known about giving. Spiritual
traditions emphasize giving. Is it
because you're some little wussy boy who
just needs to give to be a wussy? Why do
they want to get you giving? Why?
>> I just told you. Say it louder. Why?
>> Why?
>> Why?
>> Why?
>> In other words it is. Are you being fed?
They say be of the world. Say that
>> be of the world.
>> Not in the world.
>> Not in the world.
>> So when we're in the world, we try to
take maybe get energy and give. But when
we're not when we're in the world but
not of the world, we tap into our higher
power and energy flows out and it's
addictive. Whenever you if you're
giving, there's an unconscious belief
you're going to receive.
>> You're not giving to get, but you will
get. That's the belief. So you're not
will like you're not going to spend your
last dollar if you don't think there's
more money coming in. You're not going
to give anything to someone if you don't
think there'll be more. So by giving,
you're training the brain and you're
reinforcing the belief that you're going
to get an abundance from the universe.
And ironically, when you have that
belief, the actions are congruent. When
I spend more, do I want to work harder?
>> Yes. You know, at the end of the day,
dopamine needs a reward. So when you
gamble, you're looking for the money.
When you're a primate looking for an
apple tree in the distance, you need the
dopamine reward when you bite the
[ __ ] apple. the end of the day, you
need to spend your money on something to
feel good. If your brain doesn't feel
good spending money, you're running the
wrong operating system. You're actually
going against your nature. So, you need
to train your brain to enjoy spending,
spending resources to gain rewards. If
you cannot do that, you are [ __ ] up.
>> And that's another thing in the Bible
where it talks about scarcity and those
that are in scarcity will lose even
that. So, it's very, very important.
Okay. Okay. And by the way, maybe one
last comment cuz you know that thing.
>> Mhm.
>> Last comment would be when you have that
outflow, you might put all your time and
attention to the product or service and
yes, you believe in it and that product
or service fills a gap in the market,
helps somebody, all this kind of stuff,
but when you go to sell it, the person
who's buying your product or service,
who are they ultimately looking at?
>> They're looking at you.
>> And they feel this or this. And if
they're looking at you, then what that
means is that component they're looking
to see if you are congruent,
if your self-belief is there, and if you
have an agenda. They want it's not that
you can't go for the sale or go for the
win aggressively, but you are the most
engaged but the least attached. And
that's a that's a signpost that you're
coming from the right paradigm. And that
means that your energy will be very
clean. And this affects dating,
communication in general, business,
every aspect of life.
>> Guys, I thought this was such a cool
impromptu segment with Marcel and Sid.
Did you guys have fun?
>> Awesome. Give him a hand, guys. That was
really cool. That was a really cool
impromptu segment. That was dope.
[applause] Thank you for being up here.
That was amazing. Yeah, that was sick.
Yeah. Thank you. Okay, so guys, the I'm
giving a baby right now. Okay, I'm
giving you This is me delivering a baby.
Okay, when I come here, I feel my death.
Do you guys feel your death coming?
>> You should. I feel my death coming.
Women give birth to babies.
As men, we give birth to our legacy.
I don't make this video I I love you
guys and I'm here to rock your world,
but this video is meant for my children
to know who their father was. And this
video is for people who are curious
about me when I die. This is me
communicating to my future children what
I want Vincent, Dylan, and Tristan to
know.
But even though I care dearly for my
children, I think about them every
millisecond. And when I'm dead and I go
to God, I will literally ask God if I
can create a portal to send energy to
them and to be omnipresent.
And maybe God will say, "No, but I got a
great sales pitch." Okay? I want to be I
want to die for my children and die for
you to be omnipresent to send energy and
to send love from beyond the grave. I
can only I'm stuck in this body right
now. Okay? And I want and right now if
my children are seeing this from when I
die, I hope they know I'm with them. I
can see them. They can't see me, but I
see them. I love you. I think about you
all the time. I'm here for you. And I'm
here for all of you guys, okay? And
these are these what I create here. This
is my art form. And I do this because I
want to change the world profoundly. So
I'm going to show you a last couple
pieces here. And some pieces that I show
are spiritual in nature. And a lot of
people say it's all about spirituality.
And I kind of do too, guys. But I also
believe that there's pragmatic aspects
to life of things that you need. Okay?
Things that you desperately need.
Because guys, when I got to go into
nature for 5 years with my children, did
that help me with my spirituality?
Okay. When I don't have to worry about
my dating life, does that mean that I
can focus on my spirituality?
>> So, I don't know. Some people choose to
do it from a frame of sit on a park
bench like Iard. That's beautiful, too.
I love it. But I kind of just like, why
does it have to be a park bench when you
could also just go into nature not
worrying that you're flat broke and
going to starve to death?
What is more powerful of a spiritual
enlightenment? going deep into Alaska
or to sit on a park bench in Vancouver.
Look, Ekar is more enlightened than me.
Absolutely. I'm not saying otherwise not
enlightenment competition, but I'm just
saying what kind of enlightenment do you
want to have? Would it be fun to be able
to go into nature for 5 years and just
think about God and think about your
life and your legacy and beautiful
things like that? And is it very fun to
do what Sid described where you're stuck
there in a [ __ ] hole waiting to die? So,
in reality, this spirituality thing of
like just sit at an old person so I'm
waiting to die. I don't see how it has
to be like that. I think that that brand
of spirituality is from the CA case or
cast system or whatever in India where
you were stuck at a certain level and
had no chance for it for advancement and
so at least then you can meditate and I
love the bagita but I think there's
another way and I think American
spirituality is about abundance as well.
I think there's an American spirituality
something from the American dream
something unique about America. I'm
saying it's a Canadian that's about real
prosperity and having fun. I think
there's something spiritual in a party.
Why can't a party be spiritual? Does
that make sense?
>> I think there's something spiritual
about buying a beautiful watch to give
your sons. Why is that not spiritual? I
think there's something spiritual about
a beautiful organic food dinner with
your family and friends and sharing. So
why is this [ __ ] that spirituality
is all about just being broke and
meditating and that's it? Why are we
limiting it to that? I think a lot of
gurus will say that so that they can
just get you as a follower and get you
to just drop out of what you're doing
and not actually go on your personal
evolution. And as you stretch and build
into your next level, you have to become
more present and let go of attachments
and old paradigms to get there. So it's
actually a good thing to stretch
yourself not out of need or to take but
to grow. I also believe that our soul
and our spiritual life, our our life
[clears throat]
is to be pursued.
I think we have to pursue it. I think
awakening is something to be pursued.
Being an autopilot
robotic animal is not spirituality. We
have to fight and claw for our awakening
to get off autopilot and to wake up and
not to wind up in that old person's
home. So, let me show you a couple ways
to get there. Okay, does this make
sense? Making sense?
>> Is it making a lot of sense?
>> Making a lot of sense.
>> Okay. Do you believe?
>> Say, "I BELIEVE."
>> I BELIEVE.
>> SAY, "BELIEVE."
>> BELIEVE.
>> BELIEVE.
>> BELIEVE.
>> BELIEVE.
>> Let me show you something. Okay? Maybe
you don't believe, but I hope you do.
Okay? Just trying to pump you up, guys.
Like, he's trickier than to believe. I'm
trying to pump you up, guys. So what I
would say is from a pragmatic
standpoint, you find things where
there's the following. Say this with me.
Say no gatekeepers.
>> No gatekeepers.
>> Say it louder.
>> No gatekeepers.
>> Say it louder.
>> No gatekeepers.
>> Say crack in the dam.
>> Crack in the dam.
>> Again.
>> Crack in the dam.
>> Again.
>> Crack in the dam.
>> Say time efficient.
>> TIME EFFICIENT.
>> TIME EFFICIENT.
>> TIME EFFICIENT.
>> TIME EFFICIENT. TIMES.
>> Then what you do is you get back. Say,
get back my time.
>> Get back MY TIME.
>> GET BACK MY TIME.
>> Get back MY TIME.
>> GET BACK MY TIME.
>> GET BACK MY TIME.
>> Get back my focus.
>> Get back MY FOCUS.
>> GET BACK MY MOMENTUM.
>> Get backum.
>> Micro day-to-day momentum.
>> MICRO DAY MOMENTUM.
>> MACRO MONTHTO-MONTH MOMENTUM.
>> MACRO MONTH TO MONTH MOMENTUM. LIFELINE.
GALAXY MOMENTUM.
>> LIFELINE.
>> GALAXY MOMENTUM. SAY, "GALAXY MOMENTUM.
>> INFINITE MOMENTUM.
>> INFINITE MOMENTUM.
>> POWERFUL MOMENTUM.
>> POWERFUL MOMENTUM.
>> Potential momentum.
>> Potential momentum.
>> You have your potential, guys." Okay,
guys. I live like this. I This is not a
joke. Okay, look. You see You see me at
like a like a 7-Eleven. I'm relaxing.
I'm chilling. That's a side of me. You
see me at Russian Ba, I'm relaxing. I'm
chilling. That's another side. You see
me with my children, I'M NOT GOING
POWERFUL, MAN. SCREAMING AT MY KIDS,
RIGHT? RIGHT. But when we come here,
this is kind of a lot like having sex,
guys. Okay. We're [ __ ] right now. Do
you understand? Okay. Someone who's good
in bed is not just like, "Oh, yeah. Um,
right." They're [ __ ] You know what
I'm saying? So, when we're here to
transform, it means potency. It means
verility. It means genesis energy. Say
potency.
>> Potency.
>> Verility.
>> VERILITY.
>> GENESIS ENERGY.
>> GENESIS.
>> 0 to one.
>> 0 to one. creation of life.
>> Creation of life
>> where there was none.
>> Okay? So, look, I don't when I'm walking
down the street, I don't act like I'm
[ __ ] RIGHT? I'M NOT LIKE H,
you know, it's 7-Eleven, okay? I'm like,
"Yo, what's up?" Right? I'm chilling.
But the bottom line is that in an
environment like this, we want
transformation. We want potency. We want
SAY TRANSFORMATION.
>> TRANSFORMATION.
>> ALCHEMY.
>> ALCHEMY.
>> POTENCY.
>> POTENCY.
Change
>> change.
>> And is change driven with limp energy?
>> No.
>> No.
>> Is change energy limp?
>> No.
>> Is change energy focused?
>> Yes.
>> Is change energy potent?
>> Yes.
>> And that's the idea of 0ero to one.
Guys, this idea of 0ero to one is an
idea of creating something that which
was not there. So, so as crazy as the
way I'm sounding is, when I go to create
something, I lock in. That's just like I
don't go uh as I go down the street. I
don't think and act like this all the
time. But it's a side of me, right? The
girls that Marcel's with in the back are
like, I thought this guy was nice when
they met me. But it's a side of me,
okay? It's a part of me, a side of me.
When I go to create, we lock in and it's
like a nuclear reactor exploding. Okay,
you guys might not remember this, okay?
I'm the pioneer of an industry.
>> Do you guys remember that? Yes.
>> Did you notice that everybody that I
work with got rich, got famous, got
successful, became amazing coaches? You
guys remember that?
>> Okay, that was and what happened since
they left? Don't say.
>> So the point that I would say is this.
There's an electricity there, a genesis,
verility, potency, a driver that you had
to build. You get back the time, get
back the focus, get back the momentum.
You plug that in in areas where you have
a crack in the dam. There's no
gatekeepers, and you can just do it in
short time. And then that's what you do
in your spare time. And in every
generation, there's a couple little
hustles or plays that you can do that.
And you got to find the hustle or the
play of that generation. Say, find the
hustle.
>> Find the hustle.
>> Find the play.
>> Find the play
>> of my generation.
>> My generation.
>> And what happens guys is that in every
generation there's a little crack in the
dam and then eventually all the
corporations come in and plug it up
because they've got money and they wreck
it. So you've always got to be a step
ahead. Tai Lopez, if you guys know him,
he made the In My Garage commercial and
he doesn't run that commercial anymore.
Why does Tai not run the In My Garage
commercial anymore?
>> Because cold traffic got more
competitive. But he basically was the
first one to see the opportunity and got
on it. He could run unlimited ads
because cold traffic was cheap. He got
on early. That same Why is the in my
garage ad not even on the internet
anymore? Why?
>> It's not quite good enough. It's so
baller ad. But what was baller was not
the ad itself. it was that it was ahead
of his time. Eventually, time caught up
and the opportunity went out. The crack
in the dam closed. So, you've got to get
ahead of these things. Now, here's
another thing I'm going to tell you.
You've got AI COMING. LOOK AT EVEN my
business. Cameramen gone, editors gone,
accountants gone, CEO gone, marketers
gone, everybody gone. All that's left is
the creator. So guys, in the future,
here's what I would say. What's going to
be left is creating AI and personal
brand. Say creating AI,
>> creating AI
>> and personal brand.
>> Personal brand
>> because at the end of the day, if you
have a personal brand, that is not
vulnerable to AI. So, but notice that
you've got to get around people that are
locked in, RIGHT? WHAT IF I HAD this
conversation with your guys' friends? Do
they want to hear it?
>> No.
>> No. They don't care to hear it because
they're satisfied with where they're at.
Okay. There's energetic parasites that
are in them that they're not aware of.
like that's another topic and so on and
so forth. So here's what you do. You
find someone that has a crack in the
dam. Now Ibrahim, shoot me a text with
the weapons of war metaphor metaphor.
Okay, just shoot that over to me. Say
social media.
>> Social
>> personal brand.
>> Personal brand.
>> Sales.
>> Sales.
>> Value arbitrage.
>> Public speaking.
>> Social skills.
>> Charisma.
>> Charisma.
>> Networking.
>> Being an emotionally regulated source of
grounding energy.
>> Container events.
>> Container.
>> Being a connector.
>> Being a connector.
>> So, what you'll find is here's what
you'll find. Notice the commonalities of
all those. Can anyone stop you from
popping off on social media?
>> No.
>> But can you go be Can you be a Harvard
doctor overnight?
>> No.
>> No. Right. So, what is the problem with
becoming a Harvard doctor for the
average person working a 9 to5? What's
the problem?
>> Invest.
>> What's that?
>> Time investment.
>> Too much time. And how about the money?
>> So, by the way, there's a So, there's a
gate. So, repeat after me the problem
things you don't want. Gatekeeper.
>> Gatekeeper.
>> Too much money to start.
>> Too much money to start. and too much
time.
>> So those things, get rid of them. At
0ero to one, look, if you're already
rich, there's some of you in here
already successful. I'll show you stuff,
too. I'll show you. Maybe we'll learn
how to 10x it. But what I'm showing you
here is from 0ero to one, you've got to
get back all your time, all your focus,
all your momentum, and dump it into
these things that are not too
timeconuming, that don't have a
gatekeeper. Um, yeah, it's the u the
crack in the dam, etc., etc. So again,
look at these things that I just showed
you, okay? As a simple example, look at
the things I just showed you.
Is anyone do you guys not understand
what it means that no one can stop you
from doing social media? Cuz you can't
be a Harvard doctor. Ironically, social
media often makes more than a Harvard
doctor, by the way. Okay. But can anyone
stop you?
>> No.
>> Can you start it from your phone? Yeah.
>> And yet most of you didn't because most
of you are in this myasma leading
towards impoverishment later in life. So
you didn't realize that you have
millions of dollars in infrastructure
and they need creators but you didn't
think to do that.
>> Building a personal brand. Can you make
millions from that? Potentially
>> some people do, right? Mastering sales.
Okay. I love teaching people sales.
>> I love teaching people sales. And if you
know sales, some people that know sales
can go close 5, 10 grand at the mall.
Okay. So, so notice that even if you
went bankrupt, you would have you could
have you know how to do social media.
You have a personal brand. You know how
to do sales. Even bankrupt, you could do
that and and you wouldn't even need a
lot of time. Value arbitrage is this
idea that maybe you find a rich guy or
rich girl and you bring them value and
they bring you value. You know, you see
me doing parties and like huge mansions.
At one point I was competing with Hugh
Hefner for best party in LA. Why? Cuz my
buddy Big Mike was down to throw down
half a million to a million a party. I
did value. I didn't pay half a million
to a million per party. My buddy did and
I provided him all the social components
of bringing the right people. That's
called what?
>> Say value arbitrage. Say it.
>> Is there a gatekeeper for that?
>> No.
>> Is there a is there a crack in the dam?
>> Okay. Likewise, public speaking would
being a comm with me as a communicator
like this with the ski with the sales
skills that I have would I ever be
broke?
>> No.
>> So public speaking powerful potent
skill. Anybody making a hire wants to
meet a great communicator. It's a
powerful skill and no one can stop you.
You don't need to go to Harvard for it.
Okay. Networking. Say the word build a
big network.
>> Build a big network.
>> No one can stop you. You can build a big
network, right? You can do that in your
spare time. Say being emotionally
regulated.
>> People just want to be around good
vibes, people that are grounded, people
who they trust. So building your
character is free. Being a source of
grounding energy is free. Say learning
how to create social media. Say that.
Can anyone stop you from being amazing
at producing social media?
>> No.
>> [ __ ] NO. SAY [ __ ] NO.
>> [ __ ] NO.
>> OKAY. HOW ABOUT DOING container events?
Like doing your own events?
>> Can anyone stop you?
>> No.
>> So there's cracks in the dam there. You
can make money. Say being a connector.
Can anyone stop you from being a
connector?
>> [ __ ] no.
>> No. So guys, that is why over the years
people, have you ever heard it where
people will say you should wait until
you're rich before you learn social
skills or work on your dating life? You
ever heard that? Yeah,
>> but in reality, all those skills I just
taught you,
>> I learned from working on my dating life
and I learned from being learning my
social skills. So, in reality, what
they're telling you when they say to
wait to work on dating or social skills
because, you know, only when you're rich
would people like you, which basically
makes you like a target, almost like
someone needing a prostitute, needing
money for people to like you. But what
are they saying? become like a a a
computer programmer till you're 35 and
eventually buy love. What are they
saying? Okay, when in reality, look at
the skills that I got from working on
social skills or dating. Let's see.
>> Did I learn about social media from
dating and socializing?
>> What do you think?
>> Did I learn about personal branding from
all the work that I did socializing
dating?
>> Yes.
>> Did I learn about sales from it?
>> Hell yes, I did. Value arbitrage. I
learned that from it. Yeah,
>> I really did guys. I learned how to I I
wanted to do better parties from all the
people I was meeting out. I learned
value arbitrage. Public speaking. If you
go out regularly and you have social
skills, how fast do you become a great
public speaker?
>> Very fast. Okay. How about swagger? Do
you learn that?
>> Swagger is big. Charisma, do you learn
that from going out working on social
skills?
>> Networking skills, you learn that from
going out.
>> Being emotionally regulated, you learn
that from going out.
>> Social media creation, you learn that
from going If you want to have a strong
backend for all the people you meet,
>> container events is your back end, your
your deeper end funnel.
>> Being a connector, same thing. So all
THE SKILLS THAT I GOT FROM GOING OUT
MADE MILLIONS AND YET THEY TELL YOU
DON'T LEARN TO GO OUT, just get rich.
You've got to be a 6'4 gigad millionaire
to meet somebody. So just wait until you
got rich because you know you don't want
to just chase people. The point they're
trying to make is that if you're some
loser who goes out and gets high at the
club on drugs, not learning properly,
then, you know, trying to get a date or
get laid or whatever, that that's not as
healthy as building yourself up in your
20s. I get that. What they're not seeing
is that the skills that you learn is why
so many of the richest, BEST PEOPLE
STUDY MY STUFF. [screaming]
>> It's the truth, guys. The big people
that you're watching online study this
stuff and got the skills. And yet you're
not even being taught the truth that
there's a crack in the dam. You're not
being taught the truth that there's no
gatekeepers for these skills. You're not
being taught the truth that you can
learn this stuff in your spare time.
You're not being taught the freaking
truth. So you were freaking lied to
about a lot of stuff. Awesome looks
money thing. All that you were lied to
about and I can go out in a freaking
wheelchair and crush it. So that's what
I'm trying to show you here. Okay. What
I'm trying to show you, we've been on a
journey looking at starting off, okay,
on this journey of trying to get out of
the myasma, out of the low vibration
energy, out of low value for time, out
of being raw for focus, out of being raw
for momentum, doing massive audits,
okay? then using that spare time
effectively on things where there's a
crack in the dam and basically uh things
where there's no gatekeepers, things you
can do in your spare time. And then
going from what to what?
>> Zero.
>> Say that louder.
>> Zero.
>> Once you have that base money, you have
what do you accumulate? What is it?
>> Starts with the P. What do we
accumulate?
>> PR. What do we accumulate?
>> Pri what do WE ACCUMULATE?
>> P I N. WHAT DO WE COMMU ACCUMULATE?
>> P I N P R. WHAT DO WE ACCUMULATE?
>> WHAT DO WE ACCUMULATE?
>> AND THEN WHAT DO WE do with the
principle? Do we eat the lamb? Eat the
little baby apple.
>> No.
>> What do we do?
>> We leave it the freak alone and don't
eat it so that we have the time to then
just work on the actual business. And so
maybe, you know, being a YouTuber as an
example or coach or uh having a personal
brand or whatever, maybe that only gets
you to your first couple hundred G's or
million or whatever. And again, I can't
promise you'll do that. I'm just saying
examples of many people that have done
it. And so what winds up happening is
you get to that and then you put it into
having money. A guy like I gazi who you
see, you know, having the best watch
collection or private planes had a
hustle. In his case, he did a social
media agency that got him enough money
to invest. He put it in investments and
he scaled from there. He didn't need
something that was from the jump making
a gazillion dollars. He just has to get
from 0 to one, buy back his time and
scale from there. Now, a higher level
that I won't get into today, but we'll
cover this weekend is what's called
multiple ROIs. And everything that
you're doing, allowing that to get
multiple ROIs. Remember, the short
version would be back in the day, I'd
have instructors that were doing
trainings. They'd fly out, they'd have
three students, six students, maybe make
six or 12 grand. I'd go out to the same
city. I'd do a free event. I would do
cheap events, expensive events. I'd
record them. I'd train instructors
during that time. I'd make products out
of it, videos out of it, promotional out
of it. And I'd come out of there three,
400K out of a weekend. And my
instructors might come out with 6K to
12K because of what? Multiple what?
>> ROI.
>> That sounds flaccid, guys. THAT'S NOT
TRANSFORMATION. MULTIPLE WHAT?
>> ROI.
>> LOVE IT. OKAY. So then what happens at
the end of this is that's when you're
sitting there having that beautiful
flight with your children, getting back
your time, and that's when you start to
live life. This isn't life.
That's when you start to live your life.
This isn't life. This is [ __ ] This
is [ __ ] [ __ ] You've been
brainwashed. I'm showing you the
template here. I've studied this for 20
plus years. I'm a walking example of it.
I'm not perfect. And knowing me, I pick
a lot of controversial stuff and I walk
the edge. I'll probably maybe someday
I'll go bankrupt or I'll be [ __ ] And
guess what'll happen after that? I'll
build back and I've done it before and I
get embarrassed and I'm not perfect. I'm
not claiming to be perfect, but I've
learned from I chose to do some of the
hardest niches, controversial content,
etc., etc., because I believe. So, I
chose to walk to play on hard mode. And
that has pros and cons. You know,
sometimes you walk along a little thin
tight rope. Maybe you fall off. It could
happen to me. But have you guys seen how
every time I fell off, I got back on and
kept going? Do you guys see how my
skills improve, my passion improves, my
energy improves? That's the life that I
want for you guys. I want you to
actually live. Say the word actually
live.
>> Start living.
>> Say, start living.
>> Start living.
>> Stop dying.
>> Stop dying.
>> Start living.
>> Start living.
>> Stop dying.
>> Stop dying.
>> Take Satan's
>> Take Satan's
>> fat [ __ ]
>> fat [ __ ]
>> out of my mouth.
>> Okay. Is really what I'm saying at a
core. Okay.
So, [laughter]
so much more to share, guys. So much
more to share. So much more to share. So
much more potency. So much more genesis
energy. So much more zero to one.
>> But do you guys see the path? Do you see
it?
>> Do you believe?
>> Do you believe?
>> Do is it possible?
>> One of my favorite movies from the edge,
Anthony, he says, "What one man could
do, say it,
>> what one man can do,
>> I never can do.
What one man COULD DO,
>> WHAT MAN,
>> I NEVER COULD DO.
>> SAY IT WITH ME, BOB. WHAT ONE MAN CAN
DO,
>> MAN,
>> I NEVER COULD DO.
>> SAY, I'M GOING TO KILL THE BEAR.
>> SAY, I'M GOING TO KILL THE [ __ ] BEAR.
>> SAY, I'M GOING TO KILL A [ __ ] BEAR.
>> SAY, TODAY I'M GOING TO KILL THE
[ __ ] SAY IT.
>> OKAY. And what one woman could do,
another could do. And I'll tell you
straight up, guys. That's what I'm
getting at. You have the potential. It's
all there. It can be done. It's your
choice. We presented you with two paths.
A path to heaven and a path to hell. A
path to a private flight with your kids
through Alaska and a path to a [ __ ]
infused nursing home. And it's your
choice. And what I say to you
ultimately, like talking to Neo in the
Matrix, the choice is yours, guys.
>> It's up to you.
So, I'm going to show you guys some
really potent exercise in a second, but
I want to thank you guys very much for
listening. Thank you.
>> The choice is yours, guys. [applause]
